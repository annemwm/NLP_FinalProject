question 532   13
access roads for hunters
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker we have been making comments under members  statements and we also ask questions to appropriate departments regarding support for hunters
we supported initiatives but still there is nothing in the budget for programs such as access roads for hunters
my question to the minister is if there is going to be any funding available to build access roads
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as community governments we do not have any money for building roads outside of the communities
i can inform the member that my deputy minister is having discussions with the department of transportation with the federal government on whether they will increase their funding
with the past government this item was deleted and we have not set a line item yet
possibly through discussions with the federal government we will be able to obtain some funding but to date we have had not response on whether there is going to be funding available and how much
so i can t answer his question
thank you

thank you mr speaker

mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there are different types of roads there are access roads and there are different types
if we were talking about parks then that would be under the department of sustainable development
if we were talking about access roads to gravel quarries then that would be under the hamlet council
if it were under the hamlet council then that would go under our department
some communities want to build roads to parks and recreational facilities and if that s the case then we would work with the department of sustainable development
thank you
speaker
supplementary mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i believe that the minister knows that some of the roads that we build are provided or funded by sustainable development even if we have an access road to a park the hunters still use them
when the outfitters go out then they use these access roads
mr speaker in the budget that we have approved for the department of transportation we approved paving money for larger communities and there is nothing for the ones that we need in our communities

i know previously as a former government employee i know that when an employee was hired by the government and offered staff housing they had an option of either being provided with furnished or non furnished accommodations
i am just wondering whether that is still the case now that employees who are being moved into or require staff housing still have that option

i will have to come back to the members on this because i really don t know the situation but i do know that some people have brought their own furniture which i think was done in baker lake for an individual who brought their own furniture

the reason why i had asked this question to the minister is when mr nutarak asked him a question he replied that he needed approval from the rest of the cabinet members
there was no funding made available for addition for pond inlet school
when he responded that way he had to get approval from the rest of the cabinet
so therefore i asked him where they found the money or where did they re profile the money because at that time there was no money allocated for pond inlet school

teenage pregnancies
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i hate to break house rules here
i want to commend the minister of justice for his name change statement today that affects many my constituents
they are going to be a lot happier on that
my question today is to the minister of health and social services
the minister of health and social services i have to commend him today on his anti smoking campaign
there are many people out there trying to kick the habit
i know the minister himself is trying hard and he has been successful i commend him on kicking a bad habit
my question today is we happen to have the highest birth rate in north america if not canada or wherever
our birth rate is extremely high
there is an alarming rate of teenage pregnancies in nunavut
most of the time when these teenagers get pregnant they have to drop out of school and not completing their education
does the minister responsible have some kind of strategy or plan in place to deal with this
thank you mr speaker
speaker
i assume the question is directed to the minister of health and social services
hon ed picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as the member probably knows several times i questioned the former minister of health mr ng who is now the minister of finance about teenage pregnancies and about family planning
one of the things that we have done with the health and social services mr speaker is to look at awareness programs
working with the chrs working with the people we have to deal with family planning issues the concerns that are being brought forward about the teenage pregnancies and again the stress it puts on the system when we have young people having children
we know that in some communities we have a birth rate of 40 50 60 babies being born in the communities of 14 or 15 hundred people
that is not sustainable over the long term
so mr speaker at this time the department of health and social services is working with its caregivers
that s professional in the field
to deal with that mr speaker in the coming months we will be dealing with a policy on family violence or a statement to address this issue on a broader concept
mr speaker we do as a government see this as a priority of the government itself
i would like to take the opportunity to thank the member for his question and i hope this answer helps generate some level of comfort to mr mclean

thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as the member know the department of health and social services brought forward in this budget a mechanism where we would look at incorporating inuit qaujimajatuqangit within the department of health and social services by actually going out for example working with our elders
looking at other issues
as the member knows in rankin inlet we do have a birthing centre mr speaker
that birthing centre would train people working with inuit qaujimajatuqangit for example
the member asked about specifically teenage pregnancies we would incorporate some of child rearing practices
also mr speaker some of the traditional values the inuit have come to be known by and using those mr speaker with inuit qaujimajatuqangit
again mr speaker after saying that the majority of chrs and our field base staff are inuit
therefore we are incorporating inuit qaujimajatuqangit into the department of health and social services and specifically into dealing with some of these issues that the member has brought up teenage pregnancies and family planning

election of the first legislative assembly of nunavut   1999
a new beginning
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker today i would like to make a report along with other members of my committee
we will be sharing it
the standing committee on ajauqtiit would like to present its interim report on the review of the report of the chief electoral officer
election of the first legislative assembly of nunavut 1999
entitled a new beginning
mr speaker in october 1999 the legislative assembly referred the report of the chief electoral officer of nunavut entitled election of the first legislative assembly of nunavut   1999 a new beginning to the standing committee ajauqtiit for review
in addition to reviewing the specific recommendations contained in the report the standing committee has also been interested in a broader review of the elections act in the hopes of making recommendations that will ensure that this important legislation will meet the needs of nunavummiut
the standing committee has begun its review and hopes to continue it over the summer and conduct a community tour in the fall in order to hear from many different nunavummiut about how we can improve the way elections in nunavut are run
as the standing committee has stated at the beginning of each of the public meetings it has held
elections are the foundation of democracy
we want to administer them in a way that encourages participation recognizes the uniqueness of circumstances of nunavut and at the same time is effective and fiscally responsible
the division of the nwt was approved in a plebiscite in 1982 where over 90 percent of the voters in what is now nunavut voted in favour of division
in 1992 another nwt wide vote affirmed the new boundary between the two territories
later that year in november the nunavut final agreement upon which nunavut s affairs today rest was approved by nearly 85 percent
in 1993 nti created from tfn held its first election voting in the leadership that would over the next six years help to lay the groundwork for creating the nunavut territory and the nunavut government
quote from mr paul quassa president of nti april 13 2000
the standing committee agrees that this history reminds us of the strength of our democratic process in nunavut
it is something we should all be proud of
the standing committee wants to build on this history
nunavut has the largest landmasses of any jurisdiction in canada and yet our population is small
one of the challenges facing nunavut in many areas is providing cost effective and culturally appropriate services across these large distances and in communities with different needs
running elections in nunavut faces the same challenges only more so since elections are only needed from time to time
the first nunavut territorial election cost almost 1 million 977035 plus 16459138 in candidate election expenses to be exact mr speaker
the standing committee is only too aware that there are many needs for every dollar in nunavut and it is very interested in options that might result in some cost savings
there are many levels of government that run elections in nunavut that may be interested in the same issues
federal territorial hamlet housing deas nti regional inuit organizations in addition to the issues of plebiscites and referenda
one of the ideas that the standing committee has been most interested in is hearing people s comments on pooling our efforts in running elections at all levels in nunavut and creating a made in nunavut elections office to serve a number of needs and help us meet the challenges noted above
mr speaker i would like now pass on the floor to the co chairperson mr alakannuark

interpretation ends
while the standing committee has only heard from witnesses in iqaluit and rankin inlet a number of themes have emerged from the discussions to date that are worth noting at this time
the elections act is very detailed and some of the concerns that have been raised would require amendments to the elections act at some point in the future
however the standing committee is not making recommendations at this time but will do so in the final report
the following are our observations to date
timing of elections   there is an emerging consensus that elections in nunavut should be held in the fall after people have generally returned to the communities from the land but before snow and cold make it more difficult for elders and persons with disabilities to move about easily in the community
mobile polls   the ability of returning officers to go to an individual s home to enable them to vote particularly if they are ill or disabled seems to be very important to elders and persons with disabilities
this may be preferable to proxy voting in these circumstances
proxy voting   although some difficulties were noted here in the procedure the ability to vote by proxy particularly for people who are away from the community at the time of the election still serves a need in nunavut particularly as people often have to leave the community for medical treatment or duty travel or they may plan to be on the land at the time of the election
mail in ballots   it appears that mail in ballots particularly for students away from their communities are a useful idea but better co ordination is needed with various government agencies in order to ensure that the students are sent the materials in a timely manner so that they can in fact use the mail in ballots to vote
voters  list   it appears that almost all levels of elections in nunavut face the difficulty of having an up to date voters  list
judging from the presentations door to door enumeration is a difficult task and may not be worth the effort since so many names are still left out
but the absence of proper lists leads to many difficulties on election day as was pointed out to the standing committee
we need to look at better ways of getting and keeping up to date voters lists and transferring names when people move to another community
the standing committee was very interested in hearing from the officials of the department of community government and transportation as to how they prepare voters  lists for local elections and perhaps we can learn from their experience the committee is also interested in learning more about permanent voters  lists generally and some of the practical and technical concerns that would have to be addressed before one could be set up in nunavut
mr speaker i would like to ask mr iqaqrialu to continue with the report
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
age of voting   the voting age for territorial elections is 18 years
however the voting age for inuit organizations is 16 years
members were advised by nti that this conforms to the traditional acknowledgement that youth age16 should start to be treated as adults
it may be worth considering if nunavut territorial elections should use the same minimum voting age as nti and this has prompted some interesting discussions that the standing committee will be interested to hear more of in their meetings in other communities
forms   it appears that some of the forms could be improved
for example the nomination form could more clearly show where nominators should sign and where witnesses to nomination signatures should sign
proxy application forms and certificates may need to be simplified
it will be also be important to consider how documents may be transmitted using facsimile and electronic means
for example the ceo recommends that the elections act be amended to permit candidates to submit their photograph by electronic means
right to vote of election officials   it appears that certain election officials are not allowed to vote such as returning officers
the ceo s report notes that this may be a violation of their rights under the canadian charter of rights and freedoms and therefore may need to be changed
should a tie vote result after a judicial recount a by election would now be held so there doesn t appear to be a reason to prevent these people from voting
polling stations and time of voting   there appears to have been significant confusion in the larger communities that had more than one polling station and in particular in those communities with more than one electoral district
the current law states that there should be a polling division for every 350 eligible electors
people appear to support one central voting location in the community one central listing of all voters in the community and one central office location for the returning officers rather than splitting them up even in multi electoral district ridings
while a larger location would be needed to prevent overcrowding these ideas may be worth exploring further
people also support formally helping people to get to the voting station on election day although they also like the idea of mobile polls as noted earlier for those who have difficulty getting to the polls
in terms of advance polls people seem to support being able to vote at the returning officer s office prior to election day over a number of days rather than on one specific advance poll day only
working together   although there were many issues and potential hurdles to deal with before such an idea could be turned into reality it does seem that in principle there could be much benefit in working together with nti and other jurisdictions of government in running elections in nunavut
joint training developing more consistent election procedures sharing of officials and possibly a common computerised voters list are just a few of the ideas worth exploring with all levels of government as well as with inuit organizations

chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr akesuk has moved that we deal with bill 12
do you agree
opening comments by the minister
minister arvaluk you can do your opening comments now
bill 12   an act to amend the divisional education councils dissolution act
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
bill 12 is in front of you
this is an act to amend the divisional education council s dissolution act which was approved last year
once we reach july 1 2000 the divisional education councils will be dissolved and they will be amalgamated with the department of education
this bill is needed to clarify how the final wrap up of the divisional councils will occur
who is responsible for the various activities such as final audits and how those activities will occur
one of the goals that we have consistently wanted to achieve is to give the district education authorities operating at the community level closer links with the department and better access to the minister
this bill will help the community district education authorities become more responsible and accountable for education within their community
those communities that are ready will be able to take on more responsibility through an agreement with the minister
some communities are ready to do far more and this bill will help them achieve their goals
mr chairman this bill does not replace the current education act
but it does clarify how the divisional education councils will finalize their affairs
the bill provides for community district education authorities the opportunity to assume more responsibility should they choose to do so
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
the chairman of the standing committee opening comments
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i thank you for the opportunity to speak on bill 12 an act to amend the divisional education councils  dissolution act
as the chair for the standing committee on culture education and health i would like to thank the minister for his participation in the standing committee review process on this bill
the standing committee held a number of briefing sessions and meeting with the minister on bill 12 over the past few months
i would like to note for the benefit of all the members of the house that although this bill has been amended the changes were requested by the minister and the standing committee supported the amendment
mr chairman i will ask mr havioyak to read part of the bill 12 report
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
the dissolution of the divisional education council and bringing the functions of the regional education boards into the department of education would help ensure that there was more accountability and transparency in government services and would provide more nunavut wide programs and services
it was also hoped that there would be cost savings realized
the standing committee supports there objectives however the standing committee has stressed the importance of also continuing to develop local capacity in education matters and is very pleased that the minister and his department shared this vision of a local district education authority playing a strong role in education issues
we believe that the involvement of local communities local school officials and other local educational and children s organizations will be essential if we are to deal with many of nunavut s educational needs
it is the deas that bring these groups together at the community level
the bill provides that the minister shall enter into agreements with deas who wish to take more responsibilities and the minister has stated his commitment to work with deas in establishing these agreements
the standing committee commends this and looks forward to hearing more about these agreements in the coming year
the standing committee was advised that the amendment proposed by the minister was to provide more certainty as to who would be the employer of the many casual employees at the local level after july 1st 2000 when the decs will cease to exist
while all teachers and a number of full time dec employees will be members of the nunavut government staff virtually all of the other employees will now be employed by district education authorities
this includes janitors casual workers cultural instructors substitute teachers classroom assistants and others
the standing committee was advised that while the deas in the kitikmeot and the kivalliq have many years of experience in this regard it was apparently done a bit differently in the baffin
all of these people have been paid to date by the baffin divisional educational council
while the amendment was revised at the standing committee request to focus on the 13 dea office managers who will actually still be employed on july 1st 2000 the standing committee is nevertheless concerned that the baffin deas will now formally have the responsibility of about 1 thousand employees when these people start being re hired in august 2000
all of these people are formally laid off at the end of the school year and they will not be employees on july 1st 2000 and therefore the legislation does not need to formally deal with them but there may be some issues in the coming school year
accordingly the standing committee has asked for some assurance that the deas receive some support and training to undertake these new responsibilities
the minister committed that the department of education would continue to provide the payroll and support functions that the dec played in the past for any deas who wish this service
as well the minister committed that the department will investigate insurance needs and any liability issues to ensure that deas will be protected
the minister has also committed that the three community development officers who assisted in training and support for the deas will continue in the department as well as the new co ordinator and that training will be given to deas on their roles and responsibilities as employers
the standing committee will be particularly interested in seeing that this training happens as quickly as possible
hopefully by this fall as members are aware that most people on deas are community volunteers and they may need support particularly in some of the baffin communities where the responsibility of being a legal employer may be quite new to some people
there will be other matters to be worked out such as supervisions and a reporting relationship with these people and principals and the deas
the standing committee is confident that the department will ensure that this will be worked out before the fall
i will ask mr nutarak to conclude the report
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
there were a few other matters reviewed by the standing committee on this bill during the standing committee review of the follow up plans for after the dissolution of the decs
the committee reviewed the proposed organizational chart for the regional staff
members of the standing committee expressed some concerns that the proposed chart seems to repeat the existing structure with only a few changes to position titles members wondered how this would impact on the estimated cost savings as well as the ability to achieve nunavut wide educational programs and services
however the minister noted that this staff structure will evolve and that this is a transition step to ensure stability for the coming school year
as well this bill requests an exemption from the statutory instruments act for any outstanding appeals after july 1st 2000 that would have ordinarily been dealt with by the decs
the bill also proposes that anything done by the minister in the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty of the divisional educational council be exempt from the statutory instruments act
the standing committee was advised that the statutory instruments act requires that the government publishes certain instruments in the gazette including regulations appointments and certain directives and that this has the result of promoting openness and transparency of government decisions
the standing committee would like to note for the members that the whole education act is under review at this time and the committee has been advised that the draft legislation will be brought before the house in the coming year
at that time it will come before the standing committee again
if the new legislation continues to exempt the minister from the statutory instrument act for education duties and responsibilities that used to belong to the divisional educational councils the standing committee will question this at that time as we don t wish to compromise the spirit of openness and transparency which is so important to all of us
while the district education councils were exempt from the application of the statutory instruments act minister are usually required to publish appointments directives and regulations in the gazette and there doesn t seem to be any reason why the minister should not also do so now that these responsibilities have been brought within the government
the standing committee would request that the principles of openness be honoured as much as possible and the minister would consider how his appointments and any directives he gives regarding the appeals process can in fact be made available for review by the public at some point
perhaps in a statement to the house
mr chairman it is evident by what has happened in the house over the past few weeks that in addition to dealing with employees the deas are going to have to play a more assertive role in assessing their community s education needs in making their pleas for education capital and resources and in developing plans and even fundraising for the things they feel are important
the sooner we ensure that all the deas have adequate support to carry out their very important roles and responsibilities the sooner they will be able to take these initiatives with confidence and determination in all the communities
the standing committee encourages the minister and the department in their work with the deas once the decs are dissolved
we look forward to hearing more about it in the future
those are my comments mr chairman

bill 12 an act to amend the divisional education councils  dissolution act general comments
any comments
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
just a couple of comments or questions
i know the idea behind the dissolution of the divisional education councils is to devolve that responsibility down to the deas and i know that all the staff that aren t teaching staff are going to become employees of the deas
just for clarity i am wondering why those employees aren t part of the department of education staff as well along with the teachers
just wondering why that is if i could get an answer to that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minster of education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
the staff of the district education authorities in the communities there are around 13 on contract under the deas and what we are saying here is in fact that we are not going to make changes to things that presently exist in the communities these are the employees of the district education authority
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman in here it talked about providing training to the dea staff to be able to handle these additional responsibilities
now i would ascertain from that that in the past that service wasn t being done by the deas it was being done by the decs
so i guess that is the context of what i am asking
on paper they may have been employees of the deas but in every other aspect of it their payroll and everything else it was being done through the decs
just looking for some clarity here
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
only in baffin
the other employees of deas in the kitikmeot and the kivalliq their payrolls are done locally
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister arvaluk
mr tootoo did you have another question
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i know and i can use here for an example the one that i am aware of
they only have i believe a part time staff person working for them at the dea
along with the training i guess to take on these additional responsibilities you need to be able to have someone there to do it as well
i just wonder if additional resources such as py s are going to be provided to the deas to handle these responsibilities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
yes there will be more responsibilities given to the deas in time through direct negotiations with the department and that additional resources can be added as needed
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i am not on the education standing committee so i hope that i am not repeating questions that were asked there earlier
how is it going to be determined what are going to be the criteria or the formula to determine the level of support of whether a dea is qualified for one two or three or however many support staff in doing that
i know as an example here the dea deals with five schools and in other communities you only have one or two
so i am just wondering if there is a fair way that will be used to determine the resources that the dea gets
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes these have been asked by the standing committee members and we said that we would have direct negotiations with the individual deas and these will be carried out on the basis of what they desire to handle and what we can offer as a department
so there will be no set criteria for it but direct discussions will take place and an agreement will be reached through the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess if it is going to be done through direct negotiations if at the time and i guess at any time as members know our roles and responsibilities
if in the course of the initial negotiations the dea agrees to a settlement or comes to an agreement with the department if after that responsibility is given to them and they realize that they didn t totally understand the scope
they did not ask for adequate resources
will there be an opportunity for them to come back to the department to try to accommodate that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes we want to be open as much as possible
do not forget that some communities are able to do more workload than the other communities
so we will base our discussions on those abilities and there will be a process to take place in order to give them proper resources to carry out the agreement
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr tootoo any additional comments
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i have a couple more questions on the statutory instruments act
maybe i will wait and let some other members ask general questions before i continue with those
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
any additional comments
if there are no additional comments
go ahead mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in the standing committee comments it mentioned that this act would be exempt from the statutory instruments act and it also states the reason the decs were exempt from that act
i am just wondering why the decs were not required to as it fell under the department of education
the department would eventually have to have that responsibility it would fall under the department even with the decs in place so it would have to eventually be publicly put out
the ultimate responsibility for it even in the current system falls back into the department indirectly and now it is going to directly
i am just wondering if that was the case before
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i would like to have mr spakowski answer that part especially to the statutory instruments act
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr spakowski
mr spakowski
the statutory instruments act provides for an exemption for things the district education council does
if the education act provides for a direction to be made by a dec then that direction does not have to be published in the nunavut gazette
the policy behind this bill after the decs are dissolved is to put the minister in the position of exercising the decs  power subject to arrangements with deas to have them exercise them
the purpose of this provision is to ensure that when the minister is doing what the dec did before that the same legal requirements apply
chairperson interpretation
mr spakowski please make your statement
mr spakowski
currently the statutory instruments act provides for an exemption for the district education council
so currently when a district education council does something under the education act if it makes a direction that direction will not be required to be published in the nunavut gazette
the policy behind the bill is when the decs are dissolved that the minister will exercise the powers of the district education council under the education act
the intent behind this particular exemption from the statutory instruments act is to ensure that the same legal requirements apply to those things which the minister does which the district education councils did before their dissolution
so when the minister does those things that the district education council used to do they will as before not be subject to the statutory instruments act
it is simply to preserve legal requirements as applied to those things when the dec did them
the same requirements will apply now that the minister does them
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr spakowski
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i am not a legal expert
i am wondering as to what the reason was behind having that exemption for the decs
what was the objective of having that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr spakowski
mr spakowski
to try and explain why it is that way now because i was not around when those arrangements were put into place but i believe that the district education councils are exempted the same way as local municipal councils are
i think the reasoning was that things that are done under the education act by those bodies are not the sort of things that require publication in the nunavut gazette
the nunavut gazette is there for a permanent public record and things like municipal council by laws for example were not published in the nunavut gazette
i am speculating somewhat why that regime was originally put in place
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr spakowski
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in the standing committee there is an opening remarks that says the minister is required to publish appointments directives and regulations in the gazette
i believe these are the types of things that would for the department or anything under the education act could now be not required if it goes through like that
i am wondering is it necessary
i realise that it was there for the decs but as we all know these decs are no longer going to be there
it is going to be the department
so i just wonder why they would still require something like that instead of the simple fact of leaving the same legal requirements that were there
if the picture is changing then the legal requirements should change as well
could i get a comment on that mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
the exemptions are only applicable to the minister if he is acting as a dec
but as a minister you are not exempted
but to act as a dec you do
do you want to add anything to that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
we are hearing two different languages on one channel
problem for a bit
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess i wonder is the decs where the minister is going to act as the dec after the bill comes into place there is no such thing as a dec
so i am wondering why that still needs toi question why that is there
why there are responsibilities for decs that are no longer going to exist
you will have the department and the deas
i still wonder why that requirement would not be there for that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
we still have the old act
we are still operating under the old act
the old act lists the dec s responsibilities and that is why the minister has to act as a dec after july 1
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess in light of my comments i was wondering if the minister would they look at not including that exemption to be carried forward in the new act and even in this temporary one for now
because again i fail to see the need for it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
i would like to
i am not sure why the minister is to be exempted if he is acting as a dec
maybe i could ask mr spakowski to elaborate on that
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr spakowski
mr spakowski
the department of education is currently circulating a new education act
the proposed education act
that act is drafted in such a way that it does not mention decs at all
so the need for this provision will not arise in the new education act
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr spakowski
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
maybe just to get an idea of what kinds of things would not have to be reported as a result of this being in place
different appointments directives and regulations
what types of things could the minister do under the auspices of decs that would be exempt from the statutory instruments act
that he would not have to report publicly
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr spakowski
mr spakowski
the statutory instruments act is not as clear as it should be about what is a statutory instrument
one of the things that is probably included and covered by the act normally is anything that is called a direction
in the current education act there are a number of provisions that provide for education bodies to give direction and depending on how the responsibilities have been delegated an education body can be a district education council
so there are numerous provisions throughout the education act that deal with directions from an education body
so as an example there are provisions that provide for the superintendent to terminate certain employment contracts and principals and those are at the direction of the education body directing the superintendent
those directions might have to be published in the nunavut gazette if it was not for this kind of exemption
because when a dec makes the direction now it is not subject to the statutory instruments act
but if a minister makes a direction then depending on the exact context it may be
there are other examples as well in the education act relating to for example certain teaching staff having to provide support services and that is done in accordance with an education body
again if a district education gives some sort of direction with respect to that now it is not required to be published in the nunavut gazette
this amendment will ensure that it is not required to be published in the gazette afterwards
there are other examples that i could give as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr spakowski
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman based on the responses i am looking at it is more geared toward the direction of the decs
i know they are given a broad mandate they can give direction in different areas and they can have that flexibility
i guess which was there
i was wondering if there is a need
will there be any appointments or regulations those are things that are pretty standard
those are not discretionary type things where i guess my read from the comments from the standing committee is that you know that is where we are worried the appointments and regulations done and implemented without having to be made public
that could potentially cause some problems down the road
i do not know
i am just looking for a level of comfort
any appointments or regulations that are going to affect everybody the same those types of things would still be made public
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr chairman
yes they will have to be a part of the regulations introduced by cabinet for example
then they will have to be published still
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
is that the same goal for appointments as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
mr spakowski
mr spakowski appointments are not covered by the statutory instruments act at all
they are required to be published in the gazette but it is not under the statutory instruments act that they required to
so i am not aware of any appointments that the dec does so i do not believe the minister will do any on behalf of or acting as the dec
however if there were they would be required to be published in the gazette as all other appointments are
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr spakowski
i have other names
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the minister s opening comments and chairperson s opening comments none of them state when this will be reviewed again and what year it will be reviewed again
so is this going to be ongoing
this bill is going to become an act
is it going to be used for a long time
do we have any room for improvement or amendment if we have to experience some problems
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the new education act when it is drafted then this amending act will no longer be in place
this amendment will dissolve and be put into the education act
this amendment will go right into the education act
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i understand that
however perhaps it is going to be used for one hundred years
this act is going to be used for one hundred years well over a one hundred years
because there is no time limit on that
it does not even state when it is going to be reviewed again
for example if we happen to run into problems there does not seem to be room for improvement or amendments
so this has to be identified in case we run into a problem with the education system so that there will be room for amendment and improvement
so i was wondering if your department is willing to do that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister for education arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the bill for education we expect that we will be working on that education act on the second draft
we have already sent the copies to the members and to the communities and in there it will state that we will be utilising this bill and once we get to education act it will be used
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that with the minister s response that it was quite obvious that the deas will be taking on some more responsibilities and i know each community varies between each other with the education authorities
i know some deas are very capable of taking on some responsibilities
i was wondering if the communities perhaps the communities will be taking on more responsibilities if they wanted to or if they chose to
so your department will give opportunities to the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes we will give them opportunity
however the minister has to sign an agreement with the deas
the way it is now the minister of education is responsible for getting the best education system within the school
the minister has to protect the students and their education curriculum
for that reason the minister can negotiate or come into agreement with the district education authorities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i also want to get further clarification
if the minister did not agree to negotiate with the communities then there is no other room to manoeuvre
so once the community s request is denied perhaps you will be giving reasons why you have denied the request from the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes
the ministers have to protect the laws acts the policies regulation and the students
for example if we have 191 school calendar days if the communities want to change their school calendar days to 100 the minister can say no because they will be contradicting the act
so the minister has to protect and review the communities  requests to make sure that they do not contradict the act
so that is why we have to negotiate with the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i understood his response
but i still need further clarification
the act the federal act or the statues i was wondering if this act is going to be part of the federal acts
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
at this point we have inherited the gnwt act
but we are now amending the act and we still have not completed the amendment yet
once we are completed it will go through the house
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you for the response because it was clear
but i would like to say again that the minister for the deas i am sure that the minister will not be available to some deas and i am sure that the staff perhaps if the minister is unavailable will the staff be operating or running the department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the staff have been given authority to work on a day to day basis
when the communities want to have new directive they will have to communicate and negotiate with the minister
chairperson interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that was clear yes i know that once the deas will be given more responsibilities and employees
some communities have no experienced bookkeepers or finance controllers
i was wondering if your department would be providing new positions to the communities such as positions for the finance positions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we will follow the communities  request and if they do not want to take on responsibilities we are not going to be shoving the responsibilities to the communities
we will need to negotiate with the communities if they wanted to take on other responsibilities for example if they wanted to take on the employment responsibilities we would have to negotiate with the deas and have an agreement
according to the responsibilities if they need to open a position they will have to negotiate with the department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister arvaluk
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
boards and agencies usually exercise their rights and take on some responsibilities
they work with bookkeepers and other staff

mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this morning there was a question brought up by the member of quttiktuq
the question was directed to the minister of community government and transportation in regards to access roads
in the year 20002001 there is nothing allotted for access roads in that department or in the government budget
we are well aware that in our communities there are quite a lot of all terrain vehicles and it is breaking up the ground around the communities
you see tracks all over the place around the communities
i believe your department is responsible for keeping the environment safe around the communities
i would like to know from the minister what kind of plans he has in his department in regards to keeping the surrounding areas safe and in its natural condition
as i said there are a lot of all terrain vehicles that are making tracks and breaking up the environment and on that note i believe there have to be access roads built around the communities or around the surrounding areas so that we keep our land from breaking up
there is no budget slotted with the other department what plans do you have with your department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
we are getting more and more concerned with the all terrain vehicles that are used for travelling rough areas especially in the keewatin area
we had seen this outside of rankin inlet because there are no access roads built the all terrain vehicles are going all over the place
it is the same thing in kugluktuk
we tried to build an access road in there but through the iiba agreement we could not go ahead with it
if inuit are going to be effected or impacted we have to follow the policies that were made through the iiba
following the needs of the communities we are starting to try to get things going like i said last year and because of the lack of the iiba in some of the communities we cannot start construction of access roads
we have to come to an agreement with nti before we can start building anything because it does have an impact in the communities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when you were brought up on the land and when you are told that you have to wait it is a very long wait
of course once the land is ruined it is ruined
especially around the areas the elders have been brought up and our parents
it hurts to see the land being destroyed right before their eyes
it hurts them
i know it is going to be hard work but we do have to do something about it
i am representing our elders and myself and my children
i want them to live in a good environment if we do not do something about it now it is going to destroy our environment
it is going to destroy the scenery and as the nunavut government we should do something about it
the people out there would like to live in a safe beautiful environment
however it seems the only thing that we can do at this point is to do something about it and we as the people of nunavut when we talk about the transportation the only thing we think about is the airlines and the aeroplanes
but that is not the only mode of transportation there are also vehicles
we do not have highways and because of that we could at least build access roads in our communities
that is part of preservation and conservation and we have to and i think the best thing to do at this point is to do something about it and i think that is something that we should take into consideration
mr chairman i have another question for the same department if it is okay with the chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
like our minister said they would have to come to an agreement first with nunavut tunngavik before anything can be started
i am sure they will keep working on it and i would like minister kilabuk to respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it is very true all terrain vehicles are destroying the environment which is a sad case
the hunters are going all over the place
it is okay in the winter using the snowmobiles which do not alter the conditions of the land
if anybody is going to buy an all terrain vehicle or truck or any mode of vehicle we cannot stop them
we are working together with nti but there is no iiba in place at this time
it is an ongoing concern of ours especially in kugluktuk
we have been stalled at this point because of a lack of an iiba
we also provide funding for test projects and we can route some of these dollars should the communities wish to do so
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister kilabuk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr kilabuk knows that i am not from kugluktuk
i am from the nattilik area gjoa haven and uqsuqtuq
if you go to my communities you will see all the tracks and it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is happening in all the nunavut communities and it is becoming urgent and thank you for having the same feelings as i do
i would like to ask another question regarding the estimates
there are businesses that got started but have many challenges
in representing two communities and possibly because of the small population in our community we do not get enough larger facilities in the smaller communities
that was the past practice of the government of the gnwt and we have been making repeated requests to get malls and looking at how we can create businesses
it has been very hard because we do not have the proper facilities
i have had discussions with the minister in regards to my communities
there are not enough facilities
i had also written a letter to the department of national defence trying to access old dew line facilities
like i said this morning in my member s statement carvers are carving outside because they don t have the proper facilities the department of sustainable development is the only department that can do that in regards to building an incubator mall
therefore i am asking the department there are not enough facilities to house these businesses and potential businesses
what plans do you have in building incubator malls or other facilities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you if you could keep your questions brief
it would make the responses easier
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the comments mr puqiqnak made
they were long but i will try to respond to them
like the member stated this morning the carvers especially in the winter have a very hard time because they have to work out in the cold because of the lack of facilities
the arts and craft council is provided funding by our department for their operations and maintenance
of course we could work with this council or advise them what is available from their department because of the concern that was raised this morning
in addition in the communities we have cip money which is the community initiatives program
you could make proposals to access these funds
even if a facility is constructed and erected in the community we still have to consider the insurance and the om dollars and who would be liable should there be an accident inside the building
we also have to conform to the safety code
if you are going to think about building an incubator mall you will have to consider all these other issues
we cannot provide om dollars but if it is going to be an initial project then we can provide money for the planning through this program
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the operation and maintenance of those buildings that we are talking about but during the territorial government days there was a program i think that they were given subsidies to the communities such as the oonark centre in baker lake
i just wondered which department it went through where the oonark centre was subsidised for their operation and maintenance
i just wondered if the government provides subsidies to the centres
i know that some communities pay for their om in their centres such as the arts and crafts centres but does the government provide subsidies as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the nunavut development corporation is the corporation that provides subsidies for the centres such as the arts and crafts centres for baker lake they also provide subsidies for those programs so the communities can have employment in their communities
the nunavut development corporation at this time exists and they get funding from ndc but you have to realize that when they can operate by themselves they are no longer provided with subsidies
however at this present time the nunavut development corporation provides subsidies
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
what about small business incentives
when a small business wants to start up the federal government used to provide for them
do we still use the nwt s programs
say for example if i want to start up a convenience store and my application was approved if i provide so much percentage then the gnwt s policies were to provide businesses with incentives
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman yes we are still using the gnwt s policies for that
these are one of the things we are going to be reviewing this fall
after we review that then it will be geared towards nunavut
that is the way we can do them
we will probably provide the same thing as the gnwt did before
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chair
yes thank you very much to the minister for giving me clarification
usually the communities apply for funding so they can buy their capital equipment such as motor vehicles
applications that have been sent to your department how do you deal with those proposals
how much authority do you have to deny or approve the proposals
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
the applications that come up from the small businesses in the communities my officials look at the application and then we could refuse or deny the application
these are done through our department and they follow the guidelines of whether to approve or deny the certain applications
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
sometimes the organizations cannot continue say for example the htos
i know they are not very viable because they do not make too much money
another businessperson has taken on the business that was originally started off by an hto
so perhaps if you can prove the fact that i can apply or request or make a proposal to your department
if an hto had made an application to your department the proponent for example i do not know what year for example made a proposal or an application for the year 2000 if the proposal was denied or approved do you inform the applicant
how long are the applications used for
like for example if an application is made in january how long does it take your department to respond to the applicant
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
perhaps if you can ask your questions without a preamble
make your questions shorter
so if you ask a question it could be a short question it would be better for the minister
after the minister responds i would like to be able to go to mr alakannuark after
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the applications take about 2 weeks before the applicant is notified before the applicant is notified as to the status of his application
however sometimes some are delayed because there might not be someone to help the applicant fill out an application form like i said before a company or a small business that is encountering hard times to keep up his business
the business development fund assists them the economic development officers can also assist the residents in the communities up to an amount of 25 thousand dollars and show the small business how to get assistance
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this is not a question but a comment
i will not make it long
all the communities in nunavut have vegetation and it is being destroyed by the all terrain vehicles but if we are going to do anything about it and i know that we have to try and figure out a way to beautify the environment to get rid of the tracks
i think we have to talk with the local hunters in the communities if we are going to improve the environment where the all terrain vehicles travel through
perhaps if we start telling the hunters which way to travel when they go out hunting then they would not like it
i would not like to be told what direction to go to go hunting
i would not be very happy about that
therefore i think there has to be legislation brought up by the department or the government
if there was legislation to tell the hunters where to go or which way to go then it will be a lot better if it was coming from the nunavut government
like some elders that are hunters in the community can go whichever direction they want to go to go out hunting in the community
i do not think it is any of our business to tell them what direction to go out hunting
i know they do not show up in the wintertime
therefore all terrain vehicles in the summer time create all the tracks
it is not very nice to look at
at the same time we cannot tell hunters which direction to go when they go out hunting outside the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
all motorised vehicles have exhaust systems so there is nothing we can do about it
that is one of the dangerous things to the environment is the exhaust
if the minister would like to make further comments
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes as i have stated before we have to work together in partnership with everyone involved and the department of sustainable development staff will not be going to the communities to tell the communities what to do
it is the htos that represent all the hunters who should be involved and i am sure that they will be consulted with i am sure that we would not overlook the htos
i just want to reiterate that to the member here
we have to work together in partnership with the communities the community should be willing and our department should be willing to participate in partnership with the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister kilabuk
any supplementary
no
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
i have a question for the minister
the htos are now taking on more responsibilities
how are they provided with funding do they have a funding formula
could you elaborate on that to me
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we had to calculate our response because we did not expect to get that question
in regards to financing the htos it is done in co operation with the nunavut wildlife management board they fund the htos up to 3 million dollars and the department of sustainable development provides 300 thousand dollars
in total 16 million dollars is allocated to all the htos
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
just to clarify this mr chairman
the rankin inlet hto i am sure they do have an hto or the grise fiord hto how would you fund these two communities for their om
do you fund them by per capita or are we using the gnwt formula that we inherited
that is my question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes we work in partnership with nwmb and they also provide them with funding
we are using the nunavut wildlife management board financing formula for the htos
it is the nwmb s responsibility to hand out the funding to the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
mr chairman i thought you were already thanking me
the funding that is allocated to the communities i think the formula has been set by the gnwt and we inherited that formula
so i am sure that when we are going to be making amendments that we will be looking at the formula
so my question is are you going to be looking at the formula or reviewing the formula so that the funding to the htos will improve from the department of sustainable development
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i know that our review process is continuing and the results are coming out and the harvesters  support program will be reviewed as well
we have advertised for a tender to find out who is interested in reviewing the harvesters  income support program
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
you touched on iiba s before i am just wondering if there are talks going on right now with the department and with whom or at what level are you at right now in your talks with other organizations
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
last year we had requested that there be an inuit impact benefit agreement review done but we had stalled during the negotiations because none of them could identify who would be responsible but this coming june we will be able to negotiate this iiba again
we will appoint those reviewers and nti
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr havioyak do you have any other comments
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
our carvers in nunavut it is very hard to find a market and i have heard that there is too much inventory for the soapstone carvings i used to be a full time carver and i used to be commissioned to carve down south and in the states
whenever i went down south there was a huge interest for carvings i had many clients and when i got home they say that they are accumulating a large inventory of carvings
it is then evident that our artists and carvers of nunavut cannot find a market for the carvings
it is evident that there is hardly any support system for the carvers so that they could sell their carvings
since your department is responsible for financing the carvers mr chairman i am going to make an example if you do not mind
we have artists in our communities and they are excellent artists and we hear that they are great excellent artists and yet there is no market for them
that is what we hear
we have jewellery makers who make necklaces rings and who make ornaments and there is no market for them
we keep getting that response
it becomes evident that the nunavut residents have not been taken care of in that field
especially when we try to generate income through carvings
so what is the plan of the nunavut government the carvings the artists are part of nunavut and we are quite proud of this art
so what is the plan of your department in marketing
are you going to be looking for new markets to sell the carvings
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
nunavut arts and crafts association will be making plans in regards to the concerns that have been stated and we will be supporting nunavut arts and crafts association to review the marketing strategy and they will be making those plans to market the art work
i know that it is true what mr puqiqnak stated that it is very hard to market the arts and crafts
i know that they are easy to sell when you go down south but the main barriers for businesses to market is the transportation costs are too expensive and it increases the cost of the art itself
i know that when they go down south they set the market price
so therefore the market price is sky high down south
we at the department of sustainable development will not be making the directives but nunavut arts and crafts association will make those directives
through the nunavut development corporation the carvers or artists do have a little store down in toronto to promote the sale of these arts and crafts
i know that it is a challenging task when you ship arts and crafts especially the carvings down south
the freight and the market costs make those carvings very expensive and almost nobody can afford to buy them
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am very pleased that we now have a department that is supportive of our needs so how can we as the nunavut government get a better working relationship with the nunavut arts and crafts association
i think there has to be better support
i thank you for providing support to nunavut arts and crafts association so that they could look at resolving the barriers we face
i am very happy that you have committed to helping the carvers if i was rich and i had lots of money i would be pouring out money to nunavut arts and crafts association
i am very pleased that you are in support of nunavut arts and crafts association
mr chairman within one year how much money would be allocated to nunavut arts and crafts association or do you have any other additional plans financially
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we are going to provide them 100 thousand dollars and then over and above that we are very pleased that the nunavut arts and crafts association through their own means and fund raising have raised 514 thousand dollars which we as a government would not have had access to
we give them financial support of 100 thousand dollars and they accessed their own funding through outside sources that totalled about 500 thousand dollars
they have very good connections and i know that my colleague mr puqiqnak was one of the board members of this association before he became a member of the legislative assembly
there s matthew saviajuk from cape dorset maliki from repulse inuk charlie from taloyoak who are well known and that is for the benefit of the people who are listening out there
they are listening extremely hard and they are well aware of the problems and concerns of the artists in nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
to keep it as brief as possible
first of all there was one time that i attended their meeting and then i was thrown out well i wasn t exactly thrown out but i was elected as a member of this legislative assembly
i really enjoyed being a part of nunavut arts and crafts association and again for the younger generation carvers we look for softer soapstone and usually a long time ago they knew where the soapstone deposits were outside of their camps
they younger generation of carvers do not know where the deposits are and we cannot force them to come with us to quarry the soapstone
there are still some people who know where the deposits are they are not that old is there any way of helping them financially where they would be paid to identify the soapstone deposits
is it possible to provide them with funding so that we will pay them to identify soapstone deposits
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr puqiqnak if you had kept that very brief we would have got it right away
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
just recently i made an announcement in the house and through the media that we have money available for prospectors and that could be used by the carvers
in kugluktuk and arviat they could be given assistance if you want to access those funds
in september of last year or maybe in august we opened the geoscience office here in iqaluit
you could also use that office to get assistance
they are all available if you are going to be looking for deposits out there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister kilabuk
any more general comments
i have no more on my list
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
today during a member s statement i am sure that you understood where i was coming from in regards to the hunters and their need to get assistance
it is getting to be quite urgent for the hunters and of course there are able hunters and there are the ones that are mediocre like everything else there are people who are good at their profession and then there are the mediocre ones which is a part of life
i know that we are extremely hard up for money and i cannot even get a complete school because of a lack of money
because of the high cost of living it is getting extremely hard
like i said this morning the farmers get assistance and they get subsidies and so on
there are subsidy programs here in iqaluit
is it possible to look for some sort of a subsidy program for hunters so that they could get subsidised gas or some kind of a subsidy program for the purchase of hunting equipment and tools
is it not possible to talk to the governments who provide subsidies to farmers and fishermen and so on
is it possible to get subsidies for our hunters
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in looking for additional support for the hunters we could go ahead and we could look at other options
we work with the hunters and trappers organizations and we also work with the higher level of hunters and trappers organizations
we have been working together with various entities for regular hunters
there are no programs available but i would like to identify a few other programs that we do have available
for example we have a seal skin subsidy we have a fur price program humane trap development
as well in the kitikmeot keewatin and baffin we provide money for the nwmb and we are going to be providing money for the beverly kamanariak barren grounds caribou which will come from the nunavut government
that is working with manitoba saskatchewan and the northwest territories
we do provide those programs
also in the communities they have a program for up to 251 thousand for 244 fisheries programs again in the communities for outfitters we also have money that you can make proposals on
again we could look at setting up other programs
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that the htos are provided funding and from what i understand i believe that they get an additional 6 thousand dollars for hunters programs
some of the communities are using these programs very well and of course it is very hard to access these dollars because of all the criteria that you have to follow and the policies
there is one person in our community who would go out and be provided gas from the hunters and trappers organization
the hunters  assistance of 6 thousand i found is very hard to access
i believe that it was five or six thousand but it is very hard to access because we were told that if i was going to go do some test fishing i could get into the program
however if i was going to be going fishing to provide food for the community then i could not access the funding
it is very expensive to be a hunter these days
with the fox pelts at only 25 dollars per pelt and sealskins are also cheap
if i was setting up a fox trap line i would have to go very far as it is a sparsely populated area
the older ones know that when you are setting up a trap line a long time ago you had to go very far to reach the fox population
it is quite hard when it is very sparsely populated
pond inlet arctic bay clyde river have a lot of marine mammals where they can get money for seal skins and in the summer even if the seals are abundant our summers are extremely bad these days with wind and everything
so there are also problems there
i think that if you have access to these programs i know that once there is revenue coming in for the hunters our government would use a lot less money because there would be a decrease in social assistance and in other areas
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
that was more of a comment than a question
however if minister kilabuk would like to respond
go ahead
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to say that even though the members are just giving their comments it gives us ideas when we are doing planning and if we want to do some studies
it is very helpful for members to comment to our department or any department so we can get some ideas
i just thought i would say that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr irqittuq
there are no more names on my list
perhaps we can get to the main estimates the budget of sustainable development page 11   5 sustainable development branch summary sustainable development page 11 5

mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
like i mentioned this morning or yesterday we talked about the training school or the training centre there is 225 thousand allotted to the training centre
the money is there already for the 2000 2001 capital estimates
however the minister stated they have not found the location for the school
they will be negotiating where the centre will be located
the money is here in these capital items but you do not know where it is going to be
how is the negotiation is going to occur
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we are reviewing this and planning
that is going to be part of the budget
we do not know exactly where the location is going to be but i know there has to be a training centre
the natural resource officers have to be trained in nunavut
the tourism people have to be trained
there has to be a training centre
we do a lot of work for fisheries and oceans i am sorry the canadian coast guard
those are the things that we are going to be looking at and we can work with
we have to have a training centre in order to have good employees
this training centre is budgeted over here although we do not know yet where it is going to be located
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the review of the location of the training centre
does it include the building of the school
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
this is for the planning as to where the training centre is going to be located
that is what the budget is for
perhaps if the minister could clarify it again
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this planning stage is going to occur for the training centre
the study to find out where it is going to be located
if we do not find a partner for this training centre then we will be looking at whether it would be feasible to build a training centre
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the people that are going to be reviewing the location of the training centre
are they going to be the minister s officials in your department
or will someone else be involved
who else is involved
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
that is a good question
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it will be my officials that will be doing the study and it will be under my department and our officials will do it
whatever information we come up with we will give you information as soon as we have it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman mr chairman the first planning of this training centre was there already
there is a building already in pangnirtung
perhaps the first
was it a mistake when you first brought this up last year because the location was going to be in pangnirtung or did you mention to us last year the location can change
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i had this question as well to my staff
it was designated to be in pangnirtung at that time
the members were already given information as to the location that was going to be in pangnirtung
there was not going to be any community named at the beginning
that was a mistake on our part
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister kilabuk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
on the same item mr chairman
if we approve the capital estimates the training centre will have to go ahead
however we are not really sure right know exactly where the location is going to be for the training centre
it is not very comfortable to me still whether it is going to go ahead
is it going to run properly
to me it does not seem to be complete
what is going to happen to it if there are no facilities provided in other communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we had discussions that if the funding for the training centre is not used at this time then we will be able to use it for something else through fmb
chairperson interpretation

ma na itsivautaq
i can not let this go by without asking some questions
under the line art for government of nunavut buildings 100 thousand dollars it has 450 thousand total over 5 years
many communities produce arts and crafts and other things
how is the department going to solicit art for buildings for nunavut which i think it is a good idea to have our own art in our buildings
how is this going to be solicited in each community and is each community going to be treated fairly
thank you
chairperson interpretation

chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the department of sustainable development would have to have that training centre so we will have qualified employees
so we will be discussing it but at this point i do not have that information with me

some members
agreed
chairperson interpretation
going on to baffin region
total baffin region 920 thousand
do you agree
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
i want to get some clarification on some items
under the baffin region
the first item is iqaluit sylvia grinnell park
for 275 thousand dollars this year with the detail it is 1 million 505 thousand dollars over five years
can the minister explain how he can justify that expenditure for this community
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman this has been ongoing
in nunavut the sylvia grinnell park is the oldest park in nunavut and it requires improvements
for example we ll be building walkways picnic areas camping grounds fireplaces and also interpretative plaques this is one of the areas that have been neglected over the years
one of the other reasons is that in the agreement in the land claims agreement we have to work on lands that are protected areas and on maintaining these identified areas
like i said yesterday even when this has been identified as one of the places of interest it is again like i said yesterday iqaluit is a transportation link and also the capital of nunavut
we get many transients going through as tourists and so on
so this money would be used to upgrade the sylvia grinnell park
also in the land claims agreement some contracts were made by the government of nunavut that we have to go through
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
you are talking about land claims agreement
is this an agreement with the federal government and is this third party funding that is being put into this park
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes it is under article 8 under the land claims agreement
our mandate has been stated under article 8
also in regards to your question it is not third party funding
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister kilabuk
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
i am not familiar with the land claims agreement as much as i should be or article 8
however under the article i do not know what it means is 100 percent of this funding for sylvia grinnell park of 1 million 525 thousand coming directly from the government of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes
the government of nunavut is providing the funding
it is coming from the nunavut government 100 percent
i want to remind the members that although we have stated in our plans as to how many years it would be used if we can go the cheaper way or a better way there is room for changes and improvements so as to save costs
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
that camp ground that is proposed the improvements to it
is there a fee charge to that camp ground on a daily visitation
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
at this point in time we do not have a fee for campers
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
does the city of iqaluit are they contributing to this 1 million 525 thousand dollar campground
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
yes the town of iqaluit had contributed to make the access road
thank you mr chairman chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
just a statement that the minister does not have to answer
i think tourism like i said yesterday brings in 50 million dollars a year into nunavut
we know this community is a drawing card
i would want to recommend that people using this as an overnight camp ground and the facility should be charged a fee
i want to break a little house rule mr chairman if you let me
i just want to read a little article from what happened in this community a month ago
adriane clarkson the governor general hugs joseph teemootee a homeless iqaluit man who spoke with her about his plight outside the legislature
joseph teemootee lives with his wife malaya in a one room shack made from discarded wood on the shore of frobisher bay
his lone protest drew attention to the plight of the homeless in nunavut
i know it is not a question but if we got homeless people living in shacks on the beach i think that is a tragedy
because this is probably one of the only communities that has that
in most communities in nunavut we do not have homeless people
we have overcrowding in houses
when i see an expenditure in a park in iqaluit for 1 million 525 thousand and you have homeless people in the community i think that is a tragedy in this day and age and it should not be permitted
i have a problem approving 1 million 525 thousand for a campground and park in iqaluit when you have homeless people
that is all i am saying
when it comes to voting on this one i am going to abstain
thank you mr chairman
applause
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to re emphasise that the money that we are using for the plans in the estimates if they do not go ahead then it is going to keep deferring everything else over the plans that we have made for the years
also the parks and everything else would be deferred
we know that there are benefits to setting up these types of developments
however we cannot forget that there is potential to make money on these projects and that there could be spin offs for the communities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr mclean
since i have no other names
we were in the baffin region
total baffin region 920 thousand

mr barnabas interpretation
i would like to take a 20 minute break
mr chairman i would like to have the regular members caucus
chairperson interpretation
agreed we will take a 20 minute break
committee recessed at 409 and resumed at 445 pm
chairperson interpretation thank you
i am sorry we are a little bit late
would you like to say something mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
just to make it clear to the members that in our business plan it states i am not really sure if it was clear enough or not but the budget for 20002001 in the estimates that 275 thousand will be used to finish this side of the river
when you looked at the budget under the capital estimates there is about 1525 which will be used for the second phase of the work that is going to be done
this amount of money is for this year s project for the sylvia grinnell park for interpretative parks and camping areas on this side of the river
in the coming years they will be building a bridge
i just wanted to make that clear to the members at this time
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

kivalliq region 125 thousand dollars this year for the establishment of a visitors  information centre in rankin inlet two million dollars over five years
could i have a brief description and justification for that project
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that 125 thousand dollars for 20002001 is to work together with the major centres in the nunavut region
in the kivalliq they do not have a visitors  information centre
this would be like an interpretative centre and an office
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivauta
when i land at the airport at rankin inlet there is a visitors  information centre for the kivalliq in there and it is staffed by a 70 or 80 thousand dollar a year employee paid for by nunavut tourism
there are also displays in there for the region
can you tell me this 2 million dollars that we are spending in rankin inlet if this is for the new construction of a building or is that just a ball park figure that was plugged in there
or is the 125 thousand dollars this year just for a study to see what kind of a facility they need
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
perhaps i can make it a little bit more clear about the visitors  centre at the terminal in rankin inlet
there is no visitors  centre in rankin inlet so that is why they have put that tourism office at the terminal
the money for this year will be used for planning the office
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivauta i am not an expert on rankin inlet or i don t profess to know everything about the community but has the department considered in its bold initiatives and visitors centres and multi million dollar campgrounds to get the private sector involved or lease it off them or to build and lease back when projects seem to get over the million dollar range
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes thank you mr chairman
yes when we are doing the planning of the visitors  information centre in rankin inlet we will consider that as well
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
any more questions
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
on the same topic as mr mclean that 125 thousand dollars
in prior years we used 75 thousand there is over 2 million dollars to be used in total in the coming years
perhaps it will be a building it will not just be a visitor information centre but i think there is going to be a building
is that the case
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know there is 75 thousand used in a prior year and like i stated before because rankin inlet is one of the major centres and it does not have a visitors information centre we wanted to be able to have a plan to put that in there
that is just a capital projection
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister kilabuk

five year review of the nunavut land claims agreement

thank you mr speaker and good morning
first i would like to recognize a person sitting in the gallery nti president paul quassa welcome and his executive assistant lena evic twerdin
applause
mr speaker later today i will table the 5 year review on the implementation of the nunavut land claims agreement
avery cooper of yellowknife conducted the independent review
the 5 year review covers the period of 1993 to 1998 prior to the creation of the nunavut government
the results of the review are currently being used as a basis to improve on the implementation of the nunavut land claims agreement
since the creation of nunavut relations between the territorial government and nunavut tunngavik incorporated have steadily improved
we are moving forward in implementing the nunavut land claim
last year the government and nti signed the clyde river protocol that continues the important task of bringing structure to our evolving relationship
on april 1 the government is unveiled a new business incentive policy called the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy which implements article 24
the government is developing wildlife legislation with the participation of nunavut tunngavik incorporated and nunavut wildlife management board as called for in article 5 in the land claims agreement
the government is reviewing current laws and they will be amended to better reflect the realities that exist in nunavut
they will take into account the nunavut land claims agreement
discussions are on going with the federal government and nunavut tunngavik incorporated to enhance the role of the nunavut implementation panel and its ability to track each party s obligations with in the land claims agreement as is identified in the review
mr speaker our government is working with other signatories on how to improve the implementation and i know that the next review will be build upon this 5 year review and nunavut will be stronger

my colleague s statement is very good but this morning i rise to speak about what had happened during the easter long weekend
i went back home to my riding during the easter long weekend and the sanikiluaq residents held a feast and games celebrating easter
i am very proud to say mr speaker during our feast they were able to provide us with caribou meat although we do not have caribou available in our islands
in the 1970s there were some reindeer transported to sanikiluaq on the belcher islands
but today i am proud to say that we got caribou meat from nunavik
the sanikiluaq residents are no longer able to go out hunting for caribou so i am very happy that they provided us with the caribou meat
we held wonderful celebrations and mr speaker by the way i would like to say today the canada geese have already arrived in sanikiluaq

we used to go dog teaming together and of course tobacco was not readily available in those days
on our way home we travelled all night by dog team
we had tea and we had pipe tobacco
we had one kamotik and we were travelling together by dog team and were tired and getting drowsy and we started putting tea leaves into our pipe and tried smoking it and there was a fire and sparks flying all the way on our trail

frobisher inn official opening
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to thank my colleagues the regular members the premier and the cabinet members for attending the grand opening of the newly renovated frobisher inn last evening
i would also like to thank mr doug cox for inviting us there to share in the moment along with other residents and other business people in iqaluit who were there
there was a wonderful selection of fine food and beverages and mr speaker i don t know if you noticed as well as i did that my colleagues here took full advantage of this fine free dining opportunity last night
everybody appreciated it quite well
mr speaker investments like this in the community have a positive impact of the economy here not only in iqaluit but nunavut as a whole
there was as the premier pointed out in his comments there was only one negative impact that this fine facility would have and that is the fact that the members would want to stay in town longer in the newly renovated rooms that are now nicer and more comfortable
that would mean longer session and the negative impact only affects eight members that i can think of in nunavut
i think that i would look forward to longer sessions and questions periods and longer committee of the whole
so i would like to thank all members for participating yesterday

tasiujarjuaq place name project
hon ed picco
good morning mr speaker
premier paul okalik and i along with many iqaluit residents attended the official launch of tasiujarjuaq places names map project at the parish hall
mr speaker the tasiujarjuaq map is the first one produced under the south baffin place names project which began in 1994 as a project of the nunavut research institute and the elders of iqaluit and kimmirut
the nunavut planning commission and the qikiqtaaluk corporation later joined the project and helped make the production of the tasiujarjuaq map possible earlier this year
mr speaker the map contained eighty two inuktitut names of the lakes rivers channels islands mountains and other geographic features of the tasiujarjuaq area
a brief explanation of elders knowledge associated each of the place names is also included
the named features associated are outlined in colour
many of the place names in the tasiujarjuaq map were originally recorded by arnakallak an expert hunter of the iqaluit area years ago perhaps in the 1940s on the map of the south baffin
arnakallak is well known to many iqaluit residents and is my wife s adopted grandfather
participants in the south baffin place names project worked long and hard to ensure that some of the place names that arnakallak recorded were transferred to the tasiujarjuaq map as accurate and complete
an example mr speaker there is a lake that in english we call crazy lake
in inuktitut i have always called it aqitungjuk lake but i now know the real name of the lake
i would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the contributions of everyone who took part in the tasiujarjuaq phase of the south baffin place names project especially our elders
this map would not have been possible without the dedication of the interviewers who worked many hours with our elders to gather and interpret and verify the place names information
i would like to graciously thank the late abe okpik pauloosie kilabuk aseena mablick shuvinai mablick aaju peter lynn cousins and louis mccomber
sincere appreciation is also due to lynn peplinski who co ordinated the south baffin place names project since its beginning in 1994
mr speaker i would like to seek unanimous consent to complete my member s statement
speaker
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement
are there any nays
no nays please proceed mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker and colleagues
her commitment has been vital to the success of this project
i would also like to make a special acknowledgement of those people who took part in the project and no longer are with us today
mr speaker the maps will be sold in order to pay for its printing costs and help generate funds to produce other place names and maps in the future
the nunavut research institute along with other groups and individuals will continue to create inuktitut place name maps for other areas in the south baffin and perhaps for other regions
mr speaker traditional place names and the rich information that is associated with them is irreplaceable
much work still lies ahead to document the thousands of inuktitut places for the benefit of future generations

furniture for employees
hon manitok thompson
interpretation thank you mr speaker
yesterday there was a question posed to my department and i would like to make a return to an oral question asked by levi barnabas on april 27 2000
the question posed by the member was would employees moving from one community to another be giving funding to buy furniture
interpretation ends for decentralized positions in different communities public works and service is responsible to furnish these units for decentralized positions
office furniture is also going to be supplied by public works and services
mr speaker for the normal staff housing that is already in use and not related to decentralisation an offer is made to the employees based on what is available
this may be furnished or unfurnished unit and it would be up to the employees to accept the unit offered
for ordinary staff housing no decision has been made to standardise all units as furnished or unfurnished

question 539   13
transportation of government employees household effects
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
one question
i am not sure which minister this question is directed to
we saw in the newspapers that the contract for personal effects been advertised for government employees
i am not sure which minister i have to ask this question to
i just wondered whether this could be used for decentralised staff say for instance if i was from sanikiluaq and if i want to move my personal effects
i just wondered if this would be allowed
speaker
minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
i believe the member is referring to the request of proposal for moving household effects
if that were the case it is the responsibility of human resources
i would like to say yes i understand that it is closed
there are some evaluations being done
it is for moving personal effects of all employees whether or not they are specialised employees or recruitment of non decentralised employees for departments

the reason why i asked this question because i just wondered if she can encourage the cbc to bring air good news such as the tep graduation which was not aired although it should have probably been
perhaps the cbc could be encouraged to air positive news such as that event that happened last weekend so the nunavut people can be encouraged to pursue opportunities

question 542   13
infrastructure for non decentralised communities
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is directed to the premier
mr speaker looking at the business plans and the main estimates there is a lot of money set aside for decentralisation
because the more population you have the more money you are given for building infrastructures such as the tanks the roads and the facilities of course have to keep up with the population in the community
my question to the premier is i have seen new programs being introduced by the government for example there is bunch of new programs coming up for decentralised communities and i just wondered if the smaller communities can take advantage of that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes we consider those by looking at the communities that are being decentralised because it helps the whole people of nunavut
we are open and we would like to assist and support all the communities in the decentralisation process and we will keep on reviewing to see how best to assist the communities

pond inlet school budget allocation
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be directing my question to the minister of education
i would like to get a clarification in regards to the minister response when the member for tunnuniq asked him a question on april 12 regarding the pond inlet school as to what would happen to the school renovation and addition
he replied by saying 1 million 500 thousand had been budgeted for planning purposes
the minister responded by saying that during the committee of the whole that he would explain to the member as to how this 1 million 500 thousand will be allocated to the community in the main estimates
looking at the estimates and the budget to pond inlet it is only 1 million dollars
i just want to get further clarification on your response to that question
because you stated there is 1 million 500 thousand dollars in the main estimates
it is only 1 million dollars
thank you mr speaker

sometimes when we have been dealing with the main estimates for a long time and we think we know what the figures are in the main estimates and i remember 1 million 500 thousand which was budgeted for clyde river i guess i got confused between the 2 community s figures
i apologise if i made a mistake by switching the figure between the two communities
i think i was thinking of clyde river
i responded without looking at the main estimates
thank you mr speaker

home ownership programs
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for housing
we had a task force created under the direction of the minister to look at the issue of housing
there are quite a number of homeowners in the nunavut area and of course there are homeowners in iqaluit
was that issue of homeowner discussed by the task force on housing
thank you mr speaker

supplementary
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation

thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think all of us are catching a cold here
there is quite a lot of coughing going on so i would suggest to the interpreters that they close their ears when somebody coughs
it varies with rental market here in iqaluit
i am sure the rent scale follows correlates with the number of bedrooms the size of the house and so on
i would estimate it is roughly about six to eight hundred dollars a month up to 2 thousand
it depends whether it is a one bedroom two bedroom or a three bedroom unit
we have not looked at all the prices but i am just using iqaluit as an example because those are the approximate figures for the monthly rents
thank you mr speaker

status of furniture for baker lake offices
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
uqaqti my question today is to the minister responsible for public works
the question that she answered regarding staffing
furnishing staff houses i think it is a good investment going to have the younger families or the younger people applying for these jobs in the decentralized communities because they don t have to go out and buy 10 or 15 thousand dollars worth of furniture
my question today to the minister responsible for public works is there was an official opening of the office building in baker lake on april 4th that i missed because i was here
but the building is open it is empty and there are decentralized positions in baker lake right now i think there are eight of them and they are located in various locations around the community
can the minister responsible for ordering the furniture for the office buildings the telephone lines and the internet provider update me on when this is all going to be installed in the building in baker lake

thank you mr speaker
first today is my daughter s birthday i love you happy birthday and hello to the rest of my children and my wife
i would like to address this question to the minister of technical services in regards to the internet services that may be provided to the communities
the federal government i believe could provide support so that these technical services will be made available to the offices and so on
thank you
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this question keeps cropping up
there are private homeowners who do not work for the government who would like to be connected to the internet
we are reviewing this situation
i can use the example of sakku which is an organization in the keewatin area
it is the economic arm of the kivalliq inuit association
they provide internet services and these services are available to the entire public including the private sector the private public at large
in the kitikmeot area there is also a company that it starting to provide internet services to the public
everything is in the works but within the government entities we only provide internet services to the government offices and their related entities we do not deal with the public at large
the private sector is providing internet services to the public
also in iqaluit there is an organization that provides internet services
it has been under discussion but we only specifically target the provision of these services to the government offices and entities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the reason i asked that question is that i was wondering if we could market our carvings through the internet there are also private cable companies in the communities is it possible for these cable companies to be given financial assistance by the nunavut government if they should wish to get into providing internet services
with the present services we have to use the long distance services and we have to pay very high prices is it possible to provide financial assistance to the cable companies so that they can provide internet services
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i believe there were two questions that were brought up
first of all in regards to marketing carvings through the internet possibly this question should be posed to the department of sustainable development because they go into providing services for these types of projects i am sure that they are moving in that direction
also the co ops i know made a motion because they are cable providers
they were also wondering how they could get into the internet service provision business
maca was working with them to decide on whether they should get into the provision of internet services
this is different from the government my department provides services only to the government departments and entities and i also made comments on the internet providers polarnet in the kitikmeot sakku in the keewatin and here in iqaluit nunanet
i know exactly where the member is coming from and it is very expensive to run a computer operation in your home because you have to pay for long distance expenses
during the co operatives annual general meeting they tabled a motion which directed the co op to look into the provision of internet services
that was in co operation with the department of maca i do not know which direction they have taken with that directive because it is not part of my responsibility

question 548   13
amount of homeownership assistance
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for housing
with the homeownership assistance how much money is made available to the communities to get into homeownership
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to homeownership it is very important for this government to get the people to own their own homes through homeownership assistance so that there will be less back up with social housing
access homes that we built are just not decorative but very functional buildings
if anybody wanted to get one of these homes they would go through the housing corporation and go through an application process
there were some that were eligible to get more than others were because it went on a scale and that was just assistance so that they could buy a house
anyone who wanted to get into homeownership could get 15 thousand dollars through the ndap program
that pot of money was depleted but in our new budget we have set aside a different program that will be accessible to the people that want to go into homeownership
we have set aside 1 million dollars for that purpose
thank you mr speaker

is the budget allocated to different communities for homeownership
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
whoever wants to get into homeownership can make an application and send it to the communities
we do not distribute a budget to each community saying that clyde river gets so much and coral harbour gets so much that s not the way it is done
whoever wants to get a home they fill out an application form to the housing corporation
it is not distributed among each community
thank you mr speaker

mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i understand the response of the minister and i thank her for that
in my community of clyde river there is a shortage of housing and i wondered if the housing minister could think of ways to get more housing for clyde river such as homeownership for that community
i just wondered if she could make that commitment
thank you mr speaker

we have been working as a housing corporation to make sure that all the people of nunavut are provided with adequate housing

question 549   13
smoking cessation
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is a question to the minister of health  social services because he seems to be falling asleep
to the minister of health  social services if i was to try and stop smoking would i have to be using the step 1 2 3
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for health  social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker and i thank the member for his question
there are various different resources being used to try to stop smoking
as you know mr speaker one way is to use the old cerebral power that you have located just above your shoulders
mr speaker using personal habits to break the habit of smoking
there are other ways mr speaker including patches that are available through your doctor
there is also nicoderm which is one form of commercial product that is available as a gum to chew
mr speaker the step 1 2 3 process is another one so there are various different ways of trying to overcome the habit of smoking
let me say mr speaker that all of the different processes are not successful if not taken seriously by the person who is trying to break the habit
as the members in this house know it is a very difficult to break
some people have tried four five six times have quit for four or five years and have gone back to smoking the best way to stop smoking mr speaker is not to start
thank you mr speaker
applause
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there was 35 million dollars that was set aside to stop smoking for the people of nunavut
he also stated that if he had 4 million dollars to stop smoking he said he would use it
then mr iqaqrialu said that 3 million is not enough to get the people to stop smoking
i think it was about 2 million or whatever the amount was that mr iqaqrialu was talking about
i am asking the question as to whether i will be able to use 1 2 3 and i wonder if i can go right to 3 i wonder what it would be like
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker going 1 2 3 or even 4 or 5 can at times be very difficult
but i would suggest to the member that if he would like to look into tobacco cessation and quitting smoking to look at it very seriously and take whatever course of action that he deems is right and suited for him
in conjunction with a medical professional because they do have some tools available to them that they could help the member and other members and the public with tobacco cessation
after saying that mr speaker the member brings up an excellent point
that was the money that we have in our budget toward stopping tobacco from becoming the epidemic that it is right now mr speaker in nunavut by trying to target our younger people in nunavut the 12 to 13 to 14 years olds from actually starting smoking
as i said earlier it is a lot easier to stop something if you haven t started it
that s the program that we are bringing forward in conjunction with pauktuutit and other organizations mr speaker to show that tobacco is not a good product
it is very habit forming and the step 1 2 3 process that the member mentioned and some of the other things that we just talked about the patch nicoderm and so on have proven to be successful
those are the types of things that we will be bringing forward in this proposal in the budget that we have just approved so we can bring this awareness to people who want to quit smoking and indeed mr speaker targeting people who are young and most vulnerable in the smoking problem
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my last question to the minister of health  social services
he talked about the patches and the nicoderm gum
which one is better
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i don t have a critical analysis of which one is the best nicoderm or the patch
both equally to my understanding mr speaker have been used successfully but also they have been used unsuccessfully
again it takes the dedication of the person who is the smoker to withdraw from using tobacco
as i said before tobacco addiction is one of the strongest addictions that we have and it is habit forming mr speaker
so when you have a good meal you want to have a smoke afterwards when you wake up in the morning you want to have a smoke
those types of habits mr speaker are hard to get out of
some of the cessation programs that have been brought forward mr speaker for tobacco products and tobacco cessation has been centred on breaking those habits
after having a good meal for example you do something else instead of having a cigarette
when you wake up in the morning instead of having a cigarette maybe you gargle some scope or chew a nicoderm whatever works best for that person
so with that mr speaker i would like to sincerely thank the member for his question and raising this topic here today in this house
mr speaker over the next coming weeks once we start on the road the member is the chair of the health committee the standing committee on health in this legislative assembly which has been very proactive mr speaker in supporting the government of nunavut in its  anti tobacco cessation programs
i would like to thank the honourable member for being supportive and hopefully over the next few months when we are introducing some of these programs with his support and with his efforts right now in helping me quit smoking and some of the other members of this house which has been very difficult
i have been known to take some butts out of my wife s ashtray as she is still smoking it s been very difficult for me but i can honestly say that i haven t had a full cigarette since january the 1st and actually i am doing a lot better mr speaker as you know
however it is a very stressful place to be sometimes and it is stressful just being me
so with that mr speaker i would like to thank you and thank the members

question 550   13
types of homeownership programs
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for housing
i would just like to ask if she could clarify
she indicated earlier i heard her mention that program of homeownership that there was a 15 thousand dollar grant that was available
in her answer did she indicate that was a program that they plan to use this year as a homeownership program
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
that s a very good question from the member
i was indicating that we did have different programs in the past edap and ndap that i am sure that the member is aware of those programs
what we are trying to do with the 1 million dollars that we have allocated for homeownership is that we want to come up with something as down payment assistance to homeowners
we are just investigating that right now so it might be something like and ndap program
thank you mr speaker

ms thompson
hon manitok thompson

no what i am saying is that we are working on a program right now it might be similar to ndap and i will be making an announcement in regards to that in the very near future to assist potential homeowners
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i know that previously under this government the ndap program was shelved or axed i think is probably even the word if i remember correctly in headlines in the paper
could the minister indicate then if i know that program is no longer there one of the other homeownership programs that is still available as far as i know is the edap program
i am just wondering if individuals who are interested in homeownership if applications will be accepted under that program right now
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
according to my budget i just have one million dollars allocated for homeownership and we are coming up with a program that would be able to assist as many people as possible to buy their own homes
our priority right now is to build those 100 units that i have been asked to build this year
we are looking into the possibility of assisting potential homeowners
the edap program was very expensive one individual could have received up to 70 for down payment assistance
so the ndap that was made available did assist quite a few more people
we are accepting applications but we will come up with a program that will assist homeowners or potential homeowners who would like to own their own homes
i think everybody in this house is aware that we had to cut back many our programs because of the 100 units that are being built this year
the only allocation for homeowners is 1 million dollars and with 1 million dollars i can t do very much other than coming up with an ndap sort of a program that would assist potential homeowners with the limited dollars
thank you mr speaker

then i guess that leads to the question did the department just arbitrarily say in their budget that we want to have a homeownership program and we asked people to apply for it but we don t know what it is yet
i am just wondering why if you are going to allocate money for a program a program isn t in place for people to apply for
i think a lot of people would like to know prior to applying for something or even before a number being applied to a program in the budget they should know exactly the criteria that is going to be used for allocating that
i am just wondering what the people who are going to apply for homeownership money what they are applying for what are they going to be putting on the top of their application that they are applying for
because the indication if i am understanding the minister s comments there is no set program right now that people can apply for
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
what i was saying is that we no longer have a program called edap
we have homeownership money we can t call it something else if we wanted to
the edap program was quite expensive for us and we just helped a few people when we could probably have helped more because of the percentage that was given to some people
in regards to the application we are always getting all types of applications to our office whether it be for new windows doors or whatever
so i am saying that of course we invite anybody to apply and they do that to every other department in the government there are always applications coming forward even if they don t know what the programs are
with the 1 million dollars we are trying to find trying to help individuals out there who want to own their own homes and unfortunately that s all i have right now and i have to make it spread out in our territory

oral questions
mr barnabas
question 551   13
social worker recruitment and retention
mr barnabas
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker before i ask my question to the minister of health i would like to commend you on your nice bugs bunny tie
anyway mr speaker it took me almost four years of lobbying making statements to try and get my social worker
i would like to thank the minister and his staff for getting me a social worker finally after four years in arctic bay
i would like to ask the minister about the social worker recruitment troubles and shortages can the minister update me on this issue
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to thank the member for his complimentary remarks on my tie he has a nice tie too very nice and red
mr speaker i would also like to thank him for his question
actually just this morning i met with the regional superintendent for the baffin region for social services on recruitment and retention issues with one of the members of the house mr akesuk
we discussed some of the opportunities that we have with some of the members who are graduating right now with the social worker diploma from arctic college as well as looking at some aggressive recruitment and retention programs that we could put in place
mr speaker as you know we have been very successful over the past year after putting a recruitment and retention program in place for our nurses we are at a very good level of staffing there we seem to have averted some of the pandemic problems other jurisdictions have had
we have not mr speaker we have not for example had to close any health centre in nunavut like they have done in the northwest territories because of a shortage of staff
we haven t done that
mr speaker on the social workers situation maybe we should look at bringing forward some type of recruitment and retention program for social workers
i met with the regional superintendent this morning with one of the members we still for example have not got a social worker in kimmirut and that s something that we would like to be able to bring forward
mr speaker i thank the member for the question and maybe using the same type of work that we have done with the nurses bring some sort of recruitment and retention program forward for social workers
thank you mr speaker
speaker

oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
final question
question 552   13
distribution of smoking cessation funding
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be directing my question to the minister of health  social services
that 2 million dollars that will be allotted for smoking cessation will they be allotted to all the communities of nunavut so that they could do their smoking cessation programs
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker that s an excellent question
when we were designing the anti smoking cessation program and bringing that money forward we were looking at a pan nunavut wide program co ordinated through the department of health  social services and our regional offices
we didn t really look at specific community needs
but with the opportunity that has presented itself mr speaker with the standing committees on health that are being set up and i believe the last numbers were 16 out of 26 communities have now set up a health committee in their community could work with those health committees
i know clyde has that committee set up in the community of clyde river so mr speaker that is an excellent suggestion by the member and we will mr speaker bring that forward to the community
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
oral questions
supplementary
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you for allowing me to have my supplementary although the question period is almost over
the money i would like to see it being used all across the nunavut communities rather than spending the money down south or using the funding for one community we could focus it so we could distribute it evenly
i want you to commit to me that you will be considering spreading this money out to all the communities in nunavut equally
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker what we would like to do under the tobacco cessation program is to bring forward a multi faceted approach which would mean mr speaker that we would develop manuals books information materials for example here in headquarters and bring that forward to our regions and to our other communities
we could also mr speaker look at using the health committees at the community level and if for example in the member s community of clyde river the health committee in clyde river said that we would like to have 30 thousand dollars to work on this tobacco cessation program in our schools for our young people the mr speaker the member is correct we would look at doing that and supporting that community
because one of the principles of setting up the health committees in each community was issues like this advocacy issues looking at the preventative side of medicine
i think mr speaker that s a good one
i know the member had some concerns when we had the debate on health  social services with the tobacco cessation program i think the member s point is well taken and maybe with that type of information brought forward the member will be an advocate and a supporter of the program

department of sustainable development on page 11 6 sustainable development information item
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
i just want to point out something here
on page 11 6 on your grants to small businesses
as a government we talked about community empowerment quite a bit
which includes your economic development officers under the hamlets now
i know and i will use kugluktuk as an example they now have the economic development officer position that they wanted transferred to them
in the future will you be considering this part of the grants moving with the edo as their allocation so it can be handled at the community level
from my past experience as you know that anybody that is applying for gsb require regional approval at this time but i would like to see the approvals at the local level for these types of grants
i am just wondering if this is going to be looked at in the future
i think it is a good thing to look at
but i m not to limited to each community but at least instead have two approval levels one at the community level and then the region recommends approval
instead of having a small amount i think in the future you might want to see this small amount approved at the community level
i just want to point that out for something in the very near future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister if you would like to respond to that question
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am having a little bit of a problem with my microphone here
we have already taken that into consideration and under the grants and contributions we can do that
the keewatin region is a little bit more used to grants and contributions and with the willingness and the abilities of the organization it can be handed over so it does not have to go through two levels of approval

under page 11 6 there is 20 thousand dollars under the science scholarships and bursaries
it was 30 thousand dollars last year and now it is 20 thousand
is there a reason for the reduction under this line item
are there not enough students being granted these scholarships and bursaries
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman yes because of the low number or because of not enough advertisements there were not enough students accessing the money so we lowered it and we will make it more accessible to the students
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you underneath this line item under disaster compensation what do i have to do to access this money and how are you going to advertise it to the communities
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
to give you a brief overview of this item
there were a lot of times the hunters could not access the money for losing their hunting equipment on thin ice or through other accidents because it was inaccessible with the previous government and we have made it so it is more accessible
this kind of disaster compensation is more for floods and hurricanes and forest fires and so on and losing equipment through those natural disasters
now there are some changes and there will be a review of this whole disaster compensation so it will be more regularly available to the hunters and trappers
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean

under the prospectors assistance program i know there is not a lot of it going on in this region where there are individuals out looking on their own
they are spending their own money out prospecting with the hope of someday delivering themselves a bonanza of some kind while they are out there prospecting
can the minister tell me why they dropped the program from 160 thousand to 150 thousand
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
any one of the officials can respond to that question
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
last year this was the first time that we set a budget and we originally set it at 110 thousand and then we added an additional 50 thousand dollars
due to the demand of the people out there for the year 20002001 we have set aside 150 thousand
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister mr mclean mr mclean
i think i made it very clear in the house over the year that the mining industry is very important in the kivalliq region and i m sure it is as important in the kitikmeot region and it is self sufficiency here
like that 150 thousand dollars probably gets thirty to forty people out onto the land and when they are out there prospecting and out there hunting and gathering food and other items for their family
it is no secret that for this territory to be successful and stand on its own two feet and get some kind of their own tax base that mining is going to be one of the key items
it is nice to have a grant program and it was pegged at 110 and now it is at 150 but sometimes you have to invest in something early and develop it
i don t want to be too biased and start flogging mining as the answer to nunavut s woes
however i think there could be a big payback in this eventually
i think in the future you are going to have to look at increasing this prospectors assistance program because we can maybe start getting some of our young people involved in the idea of prospecting
maybe if they get interested in it and with help from their parents because there are a few pennies there to go out and teach
they may become geologists they may become miners or become involved in the mining industry and when mining does take off in this territory i think as i say again it is going to pay us back 100 fold
i was on an aeroplane from ottawa to here on wednesday there were fifty four seats and fifty three were full thirty five to forty of those people were going to the mines in nanisivik and resolute bay to mine
i am getting back to where do those tax dollars go to the area of residence that these transient workers come out of
it does us no good to bring people from outside and come in here to work for 6 weeks take their pay cheques and their tax dollars and have them collected by another province
i know people are allowed to be mobile and work where they want
so i just want to emphasise that next year these prospectors assistance programs should be a bit more proactive maybe we should start a little bit more of a campaign to get the younger people in the schools and we know there is no shortage of them to maybe get them interested in the prospecting field and lead on to a very rewarding career in the mining sector
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
just to briefly explain in regards to what the member was stating
yes we do
the prospectors assistance program is to help the people go prospecting and each person can obtain 5 thousand dollars
if the demand was high this year then we would have to go back to fmbs and we can ask them for more funding in regards to the comments you made
if the demand was high we could look into increasing that amount but this is under discussion on how we can review this
so to review what has been happening in the past i do not have that information with me now but i can assure you that we do have ongoing discussions about this money of 150 thousand which is the first initial stage
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr mclean
mr mclean ma na itsivautaq
that is the answer that i wanted to hear so thank you and i am looking forward to it
under per price program grants to harvesters in the form of a guaranteed minimum price for selected species of furs individuals must be residents of nunavut and hold a ghl
could the minister explain to me what furs get this subsidy
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
at this point a majority of this pot of funds is used for sealskins also for fox pelts but a majority is used for sealskins
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
that is money wisely spent
on this 120 thousand dollars is your department utilising is that a number that is just plugged there
once it is used you drop it
is there a demand for more on this first subsidy and if there is a demand for more on this first subsidy and it is very important to the people of nunavut and the seal skin industry are you thinking of increasing it
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairperson
also just to briefly explain again about that item
yes that funding is revolving and the sealskins that are bought are sold by auction
we were short by 30 thousand dollars last year but we will be monitoring this and i am sure we have lost a bit on that because we could not keep up with the price
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
it is no secret that we have been hearing that in the house for the last year too
i am quite surprised there is only 120 thousand dollars there
i look around at where we are putting our resources and i know that being involved in buying seal skins a lot of people depend on those seal skins to pay for their boats to go out hunting and things like that
why is this government and i am not trying to be mean or anything like that but why is this government only looking at 120 thousand dollars
it is nothing to invest into the sealing industry
is there some rationale there
the government does not want to get into the business of buying seal skins on a full time basis because nobody else will
what is the rationale of only putting 120 thousand dollars into the purchase of sealskins when there is an overabundance of them and they directly effect the fish stocks and things like that
why is there only 120 thousand dollars there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean mr minister
hon peter kilabuk
thank you mr chairman
at this point i know it is entirely true we have an overabundance of seal in nunavut but because the fur price has gone down and they are not selling the seal skins this is just a guesstimate
we expect to buy quite a lot of sealskins and we know there is hardly any market for sealskin because the price has gone down
perhaps some time in the future and we will keep monitoring it and if this amount is too small and if demand is high we would review it because the government is the only entity who buys sealskins
we will monitor it
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
i am hoping my colleagues here are going to bail me out because i am not a expert in sealskin but is there is a point where if the government subsidised a seal skin it would be attractive for someone to buy
like i don t even know what the price of a sealskin is today it might be 20 dollars or it might be 30 dollars
i think the government owes the seal hunter in nunavut a break on the purchase of sealskins and we all try to wear as much as we can and contribute as much as we can
but to me again in a budget of 600 million dollars for the government i know there are many communities that depend or used to depend on sealskins
it is the cultural thing
you know food clothing and shelter is there a point that this government could shelter sealskin sales until the sealing business picked up
would the sealskin harvesting pick up if we subsidised them by 10 dollars and buy x number more
i am sure that would make many people happy in the smaller communities where there is high unemployment
is there a point where these sealskins would become attractive if the government subsidised them
i heard someone say the other day my colleague from hall beach said the federal government subsidised the grain farmers in saskatchewan and manitoba with the crow rate and things like that
i know the government doesn t want to get into the purchasing of sealskins on a full time basis but we all have been saying that the traditional economy is important to us in the smaller communities and sealskins contribute a lot to the communities
is there a threshold where the subsidy on sealskin would make the sales pick up so they are attractive to somebody whether chairs bags jackets or anything
has your department looked at that
i know you produced a successful movie but are we going to go one step farther and help this industry come back on track
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister before i recognize you we have visitors in the gallery
brent buckler and tobi winmill they are from the young offenders and welcome to the legislature and thank you for coming over to watch the proceedings
please give them a hand
applause
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation thank you mr chairman
just to explain further in 1998 1999 that same year sealskins cost 30 dollars and with the subsidy we had to put in an additional 80 thousand dollar subsidy and it went up to 210 thousand dollars in 1999 2000 fiscal year the sealskin cost 30 per skin and we subsidized we had to subsidise them by 19 dollars and 65 cents 50 cents per seal skin
in total for 1999 2000 310 thousand was in subsidies
in our previous year we do not have that information
we do not have the total information for our previous year
we were able to get more money for sealskin subsidies because the demand was quite high
last year we had to find 150 thousand dollars from the government to subsidise the sealskins
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr mclean
ma na itsivautaq
that is good that we are getting we are putting money on where the priorities are and i have no problem whatsoever if we are looking at a 300 thousand dollar sealskin subsidy
i did not think this government even gave an eyelash on it
especially when we are building campgrounds for 1 million 500 thousand
i have heard this from numerous people that once the seal is harvested it is all used for food and clothing
it is one of the things in the bathurst mandate that builds healthy communities because seal meat is probably a very healthy commodity in the communities
it is healthy to see and the sealskin that is harvested is usually turned into clothing and things like that
i think it is money well spent
has your department looked at maybe enhancing this even more
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the sealing and fishing industries when i first came into this department i found that we were not doing enough about the sealing industry and the fishing industry
so in sustainable development we would like to create a position so that this person would deal solely with the sealing and fishing strategy
we would get into more of these types of programs accessible to the public
in our plan in regards to fishing and sealing and for part of this year i would like to see it implemented with a position whereby the person would deal solely on those issues and there would be more programs or plans going into sealing and fishing
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
thank you mr chairman
every time when we develop a policy we have to develop a person to enact the policy
that is an extra 75 to 100 thousand a year that could be put in directly to the program
it is a mainstay of the government to get bigger and when you get bigger you take money out of programs and put it into staff
i am not against hiring people to work for their jobs
but like i say i liked what you said in regards to developing a fishing policy and a sealing policy
i think these things are great
let us not get to caught up in developing a staff around it where the money by the time it gets down to the little people and this is a little people program where i think it is very important
it is like the prospecting program
it goes to the little people and it gives them money
it gives them self esteem and i know you are tired of hearing me saying it
i have three or four more years saying it
either you are going to do it or get rid of me somehow
like i say let s put the money where it is important
i think subsidising sealskin is important
i think the prospectors program is important and that is money that is well spent and really builds capacity and i hate to use that word in communities in regards in circulating money and making people feel better about themselves
thank you mr chairman that is all i have to say
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
looking at the past few operations i am sure that we will be increasing the amounts that are made available
i think it shows visibility of the department looking at the needs and meeting the demands of the people out there
looking at the fur program and the fishing and sealing strategies
i just wanted to make that comment for further clarification mr chairman
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the fur price program
foxes or fox pelts are hardly used or hardly marketable
it was one of the important materials in the olden days
do you have any plans for creating the usage of fox pelts
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i did not quite understand his question
i had to ask my official for clarification
his question was in regards to fox pelts and there have been huge decreases in the quantity of fox pelts that are being marketed today
we are going to keep this fur program going because it is needed out there
going back to the position that we are going to create who will deal solely with the sealing and the fisheries
this person is going to be looking at who we can work with in regards to those two issues
we are hoping to increase the benefits that are going into the nunavut territory
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to pelts and furs the price of seals and skins and pelts are very cheap now
one fox pelt might be about 20 dollars and in my community it would not even buy five gallons of gas for the snowmobile
what kind of assistance could you provide to hunters because from what i have noticed they wait for the end of the year in order to get money through social assistance so that they could buy the basic necessities to go out hunting
but if the price of fur pelts or fox pelts was better they could generate some revenue in order to maintain their hunting lifestyle

i was giving an overview of the monies that are made available through the grants and contributions
we are just following through with what happened last year

just a comment mr chairman
we have fox traps that are available out in the market today and there are the humane traps that are available today
they are quite dangerous to the young people if they do not know how to handle those types of traps
what can we do about this problem or we should be considering what we should do about that problem
chairperson interpretation
that is more of a comment than a question
i do not hear a question
i do not have any other names in my list
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we also set aside again you can see the information on 11 6 where we have money set aside for humane trap development
these grants are made available to inventors working on the development of humane trapping devices
for example they could be humane traps for foxes for example
there are monies set aside for inventors

community futures in the inuktitut the second down

there has been a decrease
is it because of less of a demand from the communities out there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation

there is a decrease in the amounts because there were monies available from outside
that is why there is a decrease

one the nunavut tourism core funding i noticed there is a decrease in that as well
i am just wondering at to why there is a decrease
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this is for a position in pangnirtung that was requested by the tourism association
there was an increase because that position was moved from our department
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess that difference represents one less py
under economic development officers contributions to the hamlets if i m correct for hamlets to hire the economic development officers to work for them rather than being employees of the government
it show that last year s main and this year is the same
has there been an increase or a decrease
are they the same as far as the hamlets and municipalities that are performing that function now
are there plans for those communities that are not developing them or can they take on that capability in the interim and increase the level of funding in that area
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we work with the hamlets and in their by laws it states that the communities can all have economic development officers
so this is part and parcel of the by laws that were created under the hamlet council
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess i am just wondering how many hamlets or communities now have economic development officers working for them as opposed to working for the government

all the community economic development officers in nunavut are under the hamlet councils

is it ok now by transferring the responsibility to municipalities from the department

i do not know exactly how much money we have saved with this transfer
i do not have a response to your question at this time
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess i am looking at the money that is saved in staffing
i like to see where these savings went
whether i hope they go into other programs like my colleague on my right indicated for the little people for the small people
is that where the types of savings through these types of ventures or devolution of authority where those savings go to those types of programs
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i do not have any information about when the economic development officers were transferred over to the hamlets
i do not know what their objective was as to saving dollars
the main objective was for community empowerment
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i realise the main objective is to empower the communities the decision making being done at the local level
i know from past experiences a lot of times when these types of responsibilities were devolved down to municipalities there was that cost saving to the government
i think along with empowering the communities that is one of the reasons for pursuing this type of devolution
it is simply the government at the time could not afford to continue going in that way
i am just wondering i do not need it now
i am wondering what the difference was or is between that function being carried on by the department and whatever it is now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes
once the information is available i will be make it available to all the members
i cannot tell you the amount of money that has been saved but once the calculations are done in areas where we saved
the areas where we do not provide facilities and housing

for example at this point we have made plans for all of nunavut for prospectors and this is for all of nunavut

mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
i do not know if it fits here
i want to know about explorations or studies under water if under sea projects fit in here
the reason why i am saying this is for the last three years my community has wanted to do this
however i am not getting responses from the regional office or to find some money for these kinds of studies
i want to know what is under the sea in coronation gulf and this is a big area
they are not sure what in under there
i am wondering if it is going to fit in to these projects one of these initiatives or contributions
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in the nunavut communities there have been some studies done in the past the monies that were made available through the federal government are no longer they have been deleted
however they could be used for different uses for example doing a study done on a ground fishery
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
i am not really clear
i am not getting the answer that i want
i do not understand it maybe
are you saying that it could be in one of these projects that are no longer funded by the federal government
is that what you are saying
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk
i will try it in english for my friend donald havioyak
if there was a community interested in doing a study of that type there is no reason why they shouldn t be able to access some of their cip money
thank you mr chairman

my colleagues if it is okay i would like to ask donald havioyak to take over my seat

the local radios are very old in the communities and they are very useful in each community especially the one in my community
the radio station is very old and sometimes you can even break part of the equipment with a pen it is that old and deteriorated
so do you have any funding available for improvement on the radio stations
thank you mr chairman
chairperson mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes the community initiative program could be used for different initiatives or for new initiatives
if they wanted to apply for improvements on the radio station they could apply to the cip

under page 11   9 under 251 community harvesters  assistance program
is this because the people are dying off that is why the amount has gone down
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
no it s not because we are decreasing in population as everyone is aware that at times when we have to work on programs i am sorry i was looking at the wrong one 251 yes that one
i am sorry
in order to help the harvesters we have to assist them and we made this available to the regional wildlife boards
it did not decrease because the population is decreasing
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
the assistance program is decreasing because there is less demand now for assistance
or perhaps the regional boards are decreasing in their responsibilities too
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
the reason why it has gone down is because we used to have more outpost camps but now the number of outpost camps is decreasing within nunavut
it will be part of the review of the outpost camps
it is because the outpost camps have gone down in numbers
that is why it has gone down
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo we are on 11   9
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman on the community harvesters  assistance program the minister indicated that it is handled through the regional wildlife associations
is there some kind of criteria that are used or are there any program guidelines that go along with that
i guess what i am getting at is how do people in the communities in all communities access this funding
is it funding that they can access if they need to go buy gas ammunition or anything like that
i am just wondering how it is distributed at the community level
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you
perhaps i could respond by saying the hunters and trappers set their own for example the htos provide the funding to the outpost camps and they look at how long the outpost camp has been existing that is put into consideration and it s done at the hunters  and trappers  associations
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo did you get your response
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in reading what it says here it says that the purpose is to assist holders of general hunting licenses to endeavour to harvest renewable resources
is that funding available for anyone or is it available just to those in outpost camps
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister would you like to respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
i apologize mr chairman at this point we only use that program for the outpost camps
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i was just wondering if the program should reflect the actual use by reading that it seems like anyone that needs help to go hunting that holds a general hunting license is eligible to apply to seek assistance
so i think i don t know if the program was funded more and it is just because of the reduced funding that it dropped down to only outpost camps
i think that especially in here it should reflect more accurately what the funds are going to be used for
i guess i would just ask how many outpost camps are being assisted with that amount
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
yes mr chairman thank you
perhaps there are close to 30 outpost camps that use this program also just to explain further
as i have stated before we will be doing a review and we will be appointing the people to do the review on this program as well we will review the funding program here
i just wanted to clarify that

thank you mr minister opening remarks for finance
department of finance
minister s opening remarks
hon kelvin ng
mr chairman i am pleased to present to the committee of the whole the proposed budget for the department of finance and administration for the 20002001 fiscal year
the department s primary role is to act as the chief advisor to the government of nunavut on all fiscal matters
a more detailed description of finance and administrations  responsibilities is set out in the 20002001 business plan
this plan states that the department will provide direction and leadership to ensure fiscal responsibility and assisting with the establishment of a secure economic base for nunavut while promoting and maintaining public confidence in the integrity of government operations
the department also has the additional responsibility of consolidating the annual fiscal requirements of the government s departments boards and agencies to ensure that sufficient financial resources are provided to meet assigned responsibilities and to satisfy the financial obligations associated with running a government
as well the department is responsible for reporting on the financial performance of the government and ensuring that public funds are expended in an appropriate manner
mr chairman for the 20002001 fiscal year finance and administration has a budget of 308 million dollars and an approved staff complement of 136 positions
the department is comprised of a directorate and four branches
fiscal policy and expenditure management corporate services information management and technology and comptrollership and regional financial services
the department is organized to fulfil the mandate as defined by the powers and responsibilities conferred on the minister of finance by the financial administration act
the organization also reflects the role of the department in providing support to the operations of the financial management board and the responsibilities of the deputy minister as the comptroller general for the government of nunavut
mr chairman as mentioned earlier the department s budget for the 20002001 fiscal year is 308 million compared to 275 million for the 19992000 fiscal year
the increase of 33 million is required to finance the introduction of needed information technology initiatives across government and to cover the cost of handling payroll functions for staff of the former health boards including payment of the government of nunavut s share of the employee benefits
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr minister
perhaps the committee would like to take a break to take a quick look at it i am only making a suggestion
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to read the chairperson s opening remarks for the committee of the whole regarding the department of finance and administration if it is okay with the rest of the members
i am pleased to be able to make some opening remarks as we begin the debate on the 2000 2001 main estimates for the department of finance and administration
over the past year the standing committee has had an opportunity to meet with the minister on a number of occasions
i would like to take a moment to highlight some of the issues of concern that we have had as a standing committee
the first of these relates to information management and technology
the standing committee has noted that the main estimates for the department include 35 million in increased spending on it during the coming fiscal year
while the standing committee does not dispute the need for an effective it infrastructure for the government it would recommend that senior departmental decision makers make every effort to ensure that spending does not run out of control in this area as it appears to have done in the past
the standing committee is also supportive of it training being provided to nunavut residents so as to help build capacity in an area that is heavily dominated by non resident contractors
mr chairman the workers  compensation board and the liquor licensing board fall under the minister of finance s jurisdiction
over the coming year the standing committee looks forward to making input into a detailed plan for the future of the wcb
it also recommends that a comprehensive review and public consultations take place with respect to the issue of alcohol in nunavut
mr chairman the standing committee has responsibility for reviewing the public accounts of nunavut and the report of the auditor general of canada
last year members of the standing committee had the opportunity to meet with the auditor general and his officials to discuss areas of mutual concern
we look forward to reviewing nunavut s first set of public accounts this fall
the department of finance plans to have 17 decentralized positions in igloolik
over the coming year we will be paying close attention to the success of this decentralization initiative
on the issue of public private partnering the standing committee notes that the department s business plan commits it to adopt a set of policies and procedures to govern the management of the p3 process
these should be made available for review
members also feel that the costs to government of p3 projects should be made explicitly clear
the standing committee notes that the 2000 2001 budget contained no tax increases
over the past year some members of the committee have expressed concern over the administrative costs associated with the payroll tax that nunavut inherited from the nwt
we would be supportive of a review of the current tax regime in nunavut
in reviewing the government s own source revenues we find it sobering that the government will collect approximately 320 more revenue from tobacco taxes than it will from corporate income tax
finally we note the department s business plan commitment to produce periodic variance reports on gn expenditures and revenues for review and public information
we applaud this commitment to transparency and encourage the department to make public a wide range of information including comprehensive lists of government contracts and community by community breakdowns of government expenditures
mr chairman these are some of the general areas of concern that we have had as a standing committee
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
from my understanding i believe that we will take a ten minute break after the opening remarks of the minister and the chairperson
mr barnabas interpretation

gjoa haven easter search
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker over the easter holidays community games were held in gjoa haven including a women s dog team race held on april 26
there was a severe white out during the race and three of the participants got off track and were lost in the bad weather
one of them was found shortly but it took quite a while to find the other racers
one woman was found when she started walking home
the other two were found the next day after a long night where many gjoa haven residents spent a restless evening worried about the lost racers
on behalf of all gjoa haven residents i would like to take this opportunity to thank the searchers who found them in good condition
i would have to say that i think most of the other racers did not get a good nights sleep because they were all worried about the 2 ladies
all search and rescue workers be recognised because they worked hard to find people in our cold climate
there will be a feast and part of that feast will be dedicated to the two women that were found in good condition and for the searchers who looked for them
the people of gjoa haven are thankful that these racers were found safe and sound

deferral of quluaq school expansion
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i rise to talk about the situation of quluaq school in clyde river and this government s decision to defer the expansion and repairs that were planned
i have received letters from the hamlet and the community education council that say it is going to be a major problem if the school is not worked on this year
because we live in a very harsh climate the school is going to get more deteriorated and probably will become a safety issue for the students and the staff in the school
once that happens we are going to end up spending more money for the school renovations
because of this i think it is going to become a safety issue and the parents of the students may pull their kids out of school if conditions deteriorate in the upcoming winter
it is becoming an emergency issue and we would like to see this rectified

appreciation to assembly
mr havioyak
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i am pleased to rise today to make what will be my last member s statement for our spring session
mr speaker it has been exactly one year and one month since i stood up with my fellow members and swore an oath of office and the oath of allegiance
the past year has been a challenging but rewarding one for my family and me
i would like to express my thanks to premier paul okalik and all my former cabinet colleagues for their support during the time i was minister for culture language elders and youth
i know from experience that there are issues that come before the cabinet table that are often complex and lack easy answers
the decisions taken are often difficult ones
i am pleased that i have an opportunity to contribute to the strengthening of this department which plays such a central and vital role in the direction we want to head as a new government
mr speaker i would also thank all the members for their support for letting me be in cabinet and for their support when i made the difficult decision to step down as minister
mr speaker my honourable colleague from hudson bay is in the unique position of having sat as a regular member a minister and a couple of brief days as our speaker
for me i have experience of answering questions from members on this side of the house
i know what it is like to be in a position where perhaps you don t have all the answers and can t give out much information as perhaps you would like
but this experience has taught me a few things and i know it will make my questioning effective
mr speaker i made a choice to sit as a regular member so i could take more opportunities in raising the concerns of constituents and the community
i am already enjoying the view from this new seat
laughter
mr speaker i want to wish all my colleagues a safe and rewarding summer
for me i will have an opportunity to spend time in kugluktuk listening to the concerns of my constituents and taking action
i look forward to returning to the house in a few months time and i look forward to working with all the members in the spirit of making consensus and good decisions for all communities and all nunavummiut

commissioner for oaths and notary public
mr barnabas
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as for my member s statement my question will be directed to the minister of justice
mr speaker there are some people who do read and understand some of the documents that we have to fill out which need signatures from a commissioner of oaths or notary public
there are people that are capable of reading and some stay in town for health reasons but they are capable of holding these positions
interpretationthe question i have is does the minister have in place a plan where commissioners of oath and notary public can be increased in my community
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation

the jps are capable of signing those documents if they need to be signed

thank you mr speaker

mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am sure you can go through the department of justice but i am not really sure exactly which route the public can take to become commissioner of oaths or notary public

question 555   13
homeownership programs
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for housing
on friday she had indicated to the members that mdap or the edap programs that are available for home ownership
i would like to ask the minister if the housing corporation is currently has any type of home ownership program in place right now
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
according to my budget as i indicated there is 1 million dollars that we are going to be using for the home ownership programs
that is the only program that we are looking at in this new budget
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms minister
supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker i know that and i fully realise there is 1 million dollars allocated for home ownership but in any allocation there is usually a program and a way of divvying out and distributing those funds
i am asking the minister is there a program or criteria in place for the allocation of that 1 million dollars
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
as i stated we are working on how we are going to spend this million dollars to home owners
i had to wait for my budget to be approved in order for us to start working on something
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it is unfortunate to wait until a budget is passed for programs to be developed
that is something new that i am learning i guess
i would like to ask the minister when does she plan to have the program made available to the public
i know these types of programs home ownership programs applicants would have gone through their final screening and second interview by now
if somebody wants to buy and build their home they are looking at sea lift deadlines
so i think something like this is of an urgent nature and i would ask the minister when she will be making details of this program available to the public
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
as i said i will be making an announcement in the very near future and that is as soon as possible as soon as we can work on something
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker i was wondering if the minister would be a little more specific as to when or how long has the department been looking at the programs
they started a month ago
do you expect within the next month or two weeks
if mr speaker if something is not announced soon the boat will literally be missed for many individuals that may want to take advantage of this program
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i am sure that my staff are experienced in shipping materials and stuff
so 1 million dollars according to the budget does not go far
we will make as effective as possible
it may be just for putting money into the hands of people who would like to buy homes
thank you mr speaker

oral questions mr akesuk
question 556   13
delivery of arena material
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister of community government  transportation in regards to kimmirut s arena
the announcement talked about design and that they have ordered the material or parts of the equipment by the ship
is there going to be a delay in the arrival of the arena materials
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we expect that the arena material should be coming into kimmirut during the fall
but if that is not going to be the case i will keep the member informed
but as of now we expect the materials to be shipped this year and the construction will start as soon as the material supplies come in
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister supplementary
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes i know there are quite a few designs for arenas such as the design for sanikiluaq clyde river and qikiqtarjuaq and i am sure that the design is similar to some of the arena designs for smaller communities
i was wondering if the minister could tell me if these same designs are not being used in all the communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i apologise
i am thinking along the same line that we could build the same model of arenas in all the communities
perhaps the reason why we do not use the same design is that there are different construction workers from companies and we try to get the lowest bid
i think that is one of the reasons why the design is different
it is evident if the communities would like to get the same arena design the blue prints are completed but one of the problems that we experienced is that the communities vary from each other like the foundation is different from one community to another
i can tell the member that we expect to have all the plans completed
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
oral questions mr tootoo
question 557   13
budgeting policies
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is probably most appropriate to the minister of finance
i would like to ask the minister in budget development process if he could explain a little bit how that happens to departments
through that whole process do they develop a policy and pick up how much they need or do they just put numbers out and say this is what we need without having any policies or programs in place for them
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker for this particular budget development process all departments brought forward programs that they wanted to have financed for the up coming budget that we are reviewing now
as i have indicated in the past there was a significant amount of requests quite frankly there was probably from my recollection about 80 million dollars worth of requests that were over and above for what our fiscal resources allow
so what happened was that the financial management board over the course about 3 to 4 working days spread all over a couple of weeks reviewed each of the submissions that were brought forward by the departments
they tried to determine the priorities and approved different submissions after an extensive review and debate on each of those submissions
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i thank the minister for that description on how that is reviewed
in the review take on his last answer every item in the departmental budget that comes forward it sounds like it is scrutinised quite thoroughly
in doing that review of the departmental budget are there descriptions of what and how those funds are going to be distributed so that the department defend their numbers to fmb this is how we are going to spend this type of thing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yes that is the case
each minister has to bring forward their own submissions on behalf of their departments and speak to those submissions and they are quite detailed submissions
also of course the presentation from the ministers one each of those submissions
thank you
speaker
supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
so then one would venture that to get any program or any funding out there should be a good explanation and some criteria for the dollars to go along with the dollar allocation
it should be from what i heard from the minister a description of the program and how it is going to be distributed and everything else like that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i indicated the additional submissions for incremental program dollars whether they are in the operations  maintenance side or the capital side that each minister brought forward yes
in respect of on going programs as it would have been part of the 1999 2000 budget that were being renewed as part of the overall budget development process
in other words the money the dollars that would have been expected to be carried on
there was not obviously significant review or details surrounding that because they were on going programs
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
so then if the minister is correct they are saying any on going programs would i just assume that they would carry on as is
only new programs would have been brought to the attention of fmbs for a cabinet decision
thank you
speaker
minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker generally yes mr speaker except if there were changes expected from on going programs
that would have to go back to either cabinet if there are policy changes or the financial management board if there was a result in financial changes to those programs

speaker

question 558   13
nunavut power corporation
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be directing my question to the minister of the power corporation
since we are now working toward a stand alone power corporation in nunavut i was wondering if the minister could tell me what position in you are in today in the process
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
if the members know the transition agreement that was signed approximately one year ago between the northwest territories power corporation and the office of the interim commissioner which was grandfathered into nunavut
under that option we set up our own power corporation as the member knows
in the line item in the budget of the premier and executive there is some money in there for staffing and bringing it up to capacity for the nunavut power corporation
so in this role today mr speaker i am the minister responsible for the nunavut power corporation here in nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am not the minister responsible for the power corporation that is why i asked the question because i do not know all the information
i would like to supplement my question in clyde river the increase of utility rates i was wondering is where your position is at with that one
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for the power corporation for nunavut
mr picco hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my position and the government nunavut has not changed on the new power plant and the new power rates in clyde river
it is the same as it was last year
it is the same as it was six months ago
the same as it was in february when the member asked me that question
it is the same today
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
so the rate will increase from 30 to 40 percent
we have seen it documented
so this has not changed
can you tell me this has not changed
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for the power corporation
mr picco hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker over a year ago now i went to clyde river with the member
we met with the mayor and the council of the clyde river hamlet with some senior officials with the power corporation to discuss the rate
the power corporation estimates that the new plant put in and based on the community s rates now we have in place
the rate the power rate in clyde river would increase between 35 and 40 percent
that is our best guess
after saying that mr speaker as i have said many times now in this house to the people of clyde river and to the member that we as a the nunavut government and nunavut power corporation realise a 40 percent increase in the rates in clyde river are not acceptable
we maintain that same stand
before any rate increases in clyde river there is an opportunity through the nunavut utilities board where the community of clyde river would be an intervenor
they would have intervenor status we would pay for them
there are several mechanisms to go through before there is any rate increase
mr speaker we know 40 percent increase in clyde river is not acceptable and we will do what we can as a government as i stated before to negate that type of increase
i hope that answer gives some level of comfort to the member and i thank him for his question and his interest on behalf of the people of clyde river for the 17th or 18 time that he asked me this question
thank you mr speaker

sanikiluaq power plant fire
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for community government  transportation
we heard about the state of emergency in sanikiluaq due to the destruction of the power plant
how is that going to affect the nunavut governments budget
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we have a contingency plan where we set aside some money for emergencies
if we are going to have to build a new power plant than we will get the money from the insurance and very possibly we might use nunavut government s money
but it will be reimbursed and we will probably spend about 100 thousand to construct a new plant
the majority of the dollars used will be paid for by insurance
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
again to the same issue in regards to the sudden destruction of any power plant
i was going to direct this question to the member for sanikiluaq
i wanted to know what the population is in sanikiluaq
with the increased population you have to keep up with the power demand
my question is what is the total population in sanikiluaq
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker because the previous financial questions involve more than one department and not actually directly the government of nunavut i would like to respond to the members supplementary question
my understanding is there are approximately six hundred people in sanikiluaq
just on his earlier question on whose is paying for what
the power corporation is a crown corporation
it is not a government department or agency
they have insurance coverage
in respect to actual cost of the power corporation in some of their insurers they would pick up some of those costs
there maybe some additional costs to the government of nunavut in assisting in getting the community up and running during the temporary period until the power corporation fully re establishes permanent power in the community of sanikiluaq
in that particular instance the government of nunavut obviously would pay all costs that are required to help the community
but there is also the possibility of some federal assistance through the federal disaster program which the minister of community government  transportation would work with his counterpart at the federal level and through his officials help off set some of government of nunavut costs in that situation
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i directed my question to the minister of community government  transportation and the minister of finance so i will ask my question to the minister of finance in regards to insurance
how long does it take to get your insurance money does it take 6 months or a year
how long does it take
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker it depends a lot on case by case bases and specific circumstances surrounding the claim
obviously the bigger the claim the larger the period required to recuperate or replace whatever the facility is that may have been lost
so it is based a lot on progress in replacing the insured asset so it defers to what the size and magnitude of each project where there may be insurance coverage

thank you mr speaker
for those businesses or small businesses those that were registered under bip were given forms to be registered under nni
the deadline was for april 27 and they got their forms on april 25
the forms were in her office for a whole month
why is it that you waited so long when there is contracts that have be awarded out there
thank you mr speaker
speaker
madam minister
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
it was supposed to have been brought out in march
we had short deadlines and our premier wanted to get it passed as soon as possible
we discussed the nni when we were in rankin inlet and possibly what held us back was because it took a long time to get approved
in regards to your comments saying that the forms were in my office for a month i will find out why that was the case and see if your comments are true
since you are the only one that has raised this i will speak to my staff and find out what the situation was and i will respond to you in writing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my last question if the forms are not sent here as soon as possible then they will not be registered in the nni
i just wondered whether the contractors would be able to be considered for a contract if they are not registered
i just wondered if the contracts comes out and then the shipment made will the individual that bid on the contract be considered even though their forms have not been approved
i just wondered whether the individuals that sent out those papers to her department would be considered even if they were late

i think the first part is already being looked at quite well through our consultation process with the education act
we have sent out the second draft of the education act there have been very good suggestions coming out of that one
although it doesn t really relate to the education act the comments as to how we can improve our education system the delivery the administration and the quality and the standards that should be used in the schools
the other part is more ongoing and on a smaller scale that is what programs are we delivering that can be done better if they are done differently
so those two are the components
however if we have been charged to do a comprehensive review then we will have to look at that because that will require special funding to do it
but right now we have been doing most of our in house review especially the reviews from the previous government respecting education and we have asked ourselves as professionals as to if most of them are relevant for nunavut or if they should be looked at more comprehensively

supplementary mr mclean

we re getting there
my final supplementary on this one is that the reason i am asking is because we probably have an 85 drop out rate in nunavut at this time give or take 5
usually when students get into grade 10 11 12 they re writing the alberta curriculum exams and a lot of them fall off because a lot of them don t have the basic skills in english math and sciences to pass these tests
that s where our drop out rate starts to increase
can the minister commit to finding out if the programs from kindergarten to grade 9 are effective enough to give the students the skills so when they get in to grades 10 11 12 they can pass these tests and receive their graduation diplomas
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
that is a very good question
i have asked that question and many parents have asked that question
yes we will look at all the aspects of educational programs from kindergarten to grade 12 with a goal to improve not only the quality of the education but the graduation rates
i think the member is very well aware that the success of these students not only relies on the educational process as an institution in the school but also the society
how the society deals with the importance of education
so we have been having a very intensive discussion with our staff members and the deas about how we can have the attitude of the society to change its  views on the importance of education
i am very happy that this government is taking education as a priority and it certainly will be sending a message to the parents and look at our own programs as to how we can make anything successful
one of the things that we have found out so far is that you have to have the parents participate themselves with their own creative element upgrading programs at least to appreciate the need for a good education
so this is one of the first steps
the second step that we ll also be looking at is how do we make our delivery programs in the schools with our curriculum and materials so that it excites students rather that boring them
so those are a number of ideas that have been discussed with the professional consultants with the citizens themselves and with the teachers and parents

oral questions
mr tootoo
question 563   13
budget process cycle
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister of finance
i was reviewing my hansard from previous weeks and if the minister remembers me asking about the capital budget delivery cycle
i reviewed his answer at the time and he said yes he would look at doing it in the fall and then everything else went basically that we did and it s not worth it to do
i would just like to ask the minister if he plans on doing an analysis at looking at having a capital delivery cycle having the budget developed for the fall and will he be providing that information to the house
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i have indicated in response to the honourable member s questions it was taken into consideration and as i said i didn t think it would be doable or as doable
i guess the practicality of having two budget sessions was a consideration as i said
in the past the gnwt tried it and it was proven to be although you do approve your capital earlier and don t have to have timelines imposed upon us like we have in this current session
it wasn t that beneficial with that one exception
i guess having said that we anticipated that we would get the whole main estimates capital and so on earlier to the assembly in the next budget cycle and that s the avenue that we are pursuing for the next budget cycle
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i can understand if at least in the past it was done on a trial basis by the gnwt mr speaker and guess it didn t seem to be feasible
mr speaker i think we all understand the diversity that the previous gnwt government had where it had communities that didn t have road access year around access and communities that were on the road system
so i could see where that could cause some problems there with that type of a system
however here in nunavut every single community that we have isn t accessible by road and requires sealift
i am just wondering if in that light i think it is a little bit different circumstances than those faced by the gnwt
if the minister would consider taking a look at that possibility
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yes we would be willing to take a look at it but as members know right now we are trying to put together a draft five year planning document for members and nunavummiut across the territories so we can have a better indication of what we want to try and do from a capital perspective
so it would be a matter of trying to tie that work in at the same time and i can certainly take a look at it and report back to the committees on that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
i look forward to seeing that
in regards to the five year capital plan that the minister indicated
i believe that he said earlier that he plans on having that plan ready for this fall
i am just wondering if that is something that members will be able to review and also be able to take back to the communities for a consultation on
i guess my concern and it is through history which showed that these five year capital plans were always developed but not always followed
some people i believe said here in the house that they had something on the five year capital plan for more than five years now
so i guess that s where some of the concern would be and i think by doing that cycle earlier in the fall it may help eliminate some of that problem
so i do again ask that it be something that we seriously as a government look at doing
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
yes thank you mr speaker
mr speaker as i have indicated again in respect to the draft five year capital plan members will have an opportunity to review it
that s the whole basis of trying to develop one
i go back to saying i guess that we are concerned about having things put into the five year capital plan because there are expectations once you have put something on paper
that s the concern and the issue surrounding the development of a realistic and deliverable five year capital plan that our government wants to undertake
once we see it on paper then we want to be able to commit to delivering that within the term of our government
that s why we want to take care to make sure that it s done in a positive manner in a realistic manner so that there aren t failed expectations of people having something in that five year draft capital plan

oral questions
oral questions
mr puqiqnak
question 564   13
status of new social housing
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be directing my question to the minister of public works
we all understand i think it was last summer that the communities understood that the 26 communities would be receiving 100 public housing units
i am sure that the construction of these 100 units will require contractors
since your department is responsible for awarding contracts are you now working towards getting the contractors at this time
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes
we are in the process of working on the contracts
thank you
speaker
supplementary
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
as we have stated before during the committee of the whole sessions there are contractors in our communities at the local level
it is evident that these local contractors will not be able to put in a bid but there are two communities uqsuqtuq and taloyoak gjoa haven and i am sure that they will be putting in their bids because they have worked on contracts in the past
sometimes we do get contractors from outside the community
if possible i would like to see our local contractors at the community level being awarded those contracts to build those units
i was wondering if your department could focus on the local contractors
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
according to the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy which was passed in this house we will follow those criteria but at this point we are now working on those
i myself as the minister responsible for public works i cannot encourage the staff to give contracts to specific companies
it is against my policies and i cannot interfere with the awarding of the contracts
but i do understand your concern that the local contractors we should all work together to hire them and i am sure that the members of the legislature are aware of this
we would like to contract local companies and i am sure that the members of the legislature would like to see the local contractors being awarded the contracts
that s why we came out with the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy so as to enhance the private contractors at the community level
i am sure that the local contractors will develop through the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti but mr speaker i cannot tell you who will be awarded contracts
but as we speak they are working on it
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i appreciate the minister for being very sensitive and clear with her responses
i am sure as i have stated before the two communities that i represent the local contractors will try to put in a bid
however if there were any problems for example if they were not registered at the bip level they should be told if they are not eligible to put in a bid on a contract
therefore i would like you to inform the local contractors why they would not be able to put in a bid for contracts
i would like a document that states that and explains that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the businesspeople if they are not awarded a contract they are given the reasons
i am sure that i will consult with the member if his local companies are not awarded a contract
i do not even know if those local companies that he is talking about have put in a bid
i never know who puts in a bid or not
according to the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy those criteria are used
it is my responsibility to make sure the departments are following the nunavummi nangminiqaqtunik ikajuuti policy i will inform the member and i am sure my staff will inform communities as to who was awarded a contract and who was not
i know mr speaker that we want to be sensitive to the communities and we want to develop the local companies
in the new policy it states that we have to develop and train the local contractors
under article 24 we have to use this article under the land claims agreement to help develop nunavut companies and we are still working on that now
mr speaker i know that you want me to rush but unintentionally i talk so fast that the interpreters cannot keep up with me
so today i am trying to speak slower so that the interpreters can keep up with me
so i will inform you and consult with you

official emblems
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
whereas it is the practice throughout canada for provinces and territories to select official symbols and emblems that reflect the uniqueness and character of each jurisdiction and its peoples
and whereas the full caucus of this legislative assembly agreed last year at its baker lake retreat to seek input from the nunavut public in the selection of official symbols of nunavut to accompany the flag and coat of arms
and whereas the speaker of the legislative assembly conducted an official symbols campaign last year
and whereas 249 suggestions for official symbols were submitted by residents of nunavut and considered by the elected members of this legislative assembly
now therefore i move seconded by the honourable member for rankin inlet south whale cove that the purple saxifrage saxifraga oppositifolia be adopted as the floral emblem of nunavut
and furthermore that this house recommend that a new floral emblem act for nunavut be introduced by the government at the next session of the legislative assembly
and furthermore that the canadian inuit dog canis familiaris borealis be adopted as the official animal of nunavut
and furthermore that the rock ptarmigan lagopus mutus be adopted as the official bird of nunavut

mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker thank you for the opportunity to speak to the motion
i would also like to thank the honourable manitok thompson for seconding the motion
mr speaker it is a great honour for me to speak today to this motion to designate new official symbols of nunavut to accompany our flag and coat of arms
i am also very pleased that these are being announced in the early spring when the colours of our land begin to return
as members of the legislative assembly know our flag and coat of arms were unveiled on april 1 1999
since then there has been significant public interest    both from within canada and abroad    as to what are other official symbols of our new territory
prior to the creation of nunavut the floral emblem act of the nwt was not duplicated for nunavut leaving us free to designate a flower of our choice to represent nunavut
and to date no animals or birds have been officially designated
last year mr speaker over 249 suggestions were received from nunavut residents as to what would be appropriate symbols for nunavut
a wide variety of birds flowers and animals were nominated from people across the territory
mr speaker all members of the legislative assembly participated in discussing what official symbols should be designated at this time
as you know mr speaker legislatures across canada designate new symbols for their jurisdiction from time to time
i am certain that during the years to come additional symbols will be designated by this house
mr speaker the purple saxifrage is one of the three species of wild flowers depicted in nunavut s coat of arms
this beautiful flower begins to bloom in june
its hardiness usefulness and ability to grow successfully in extreme climates makes it a fitting symbol for nunavut
in the past the saxifrage was used for tea giving sustenance and comfort to families and communities
mr speaker there are many variants in english for the name of the canadian inuit dog
in inuktitut we know it as the qimmiq
the inuit dog has been essential to the survival of the inuit for as long as there have been people inhabiting this land
the qimmiq the inuit dog is as much a part of the lives of nunavummiut today as it was for our ancestors
mr speaker the rock ptarmigan is the most boreal of the ptarmigan family
its range extends from the baffin to the kitikmeot from the belcher islands to the high arctic
it is a bird for all of nunavut
mr speaker thank you for permitting me to speak to the motion
i am confident that these official symbols we are designating today will be seen in the eyes of all canadians as appropriate and unique reflections of our home

thank you mr chairman
the regular caucus met and we want start with the department of finance and administration with the minister at the witness table

minister would you like to bring in your staff to the witness table
today being monday i would like to take the opportunity to welcome the members back to the house
we will deal with the department of finance and administration
welcome mr minister and your staff
we are under general comments and questions to the department of finance and administration
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
under general comments i will want to get some clarification on the department of finance
whenever they do the budget for the year i want to know exactly how they go about dealing with planning the budget
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
did you get the question mr minister
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
first mr chairman if i may introduce my witnesses here with me
to my right is mr bob vardy the deputy minister and to my left mr victor tootoo my assistant deputy minister both are from finance and administration
to answer to the honourable member s question what happens is the department puts together for the financial management board a fiscal outlook on what to expect to generate and receive revenues
then we at the same time review what each department s requests are for funding from the past year and for the current year and try to put together based on those revenues and expected revenues and expected expenditures
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
i am sorry i did not ask you to introduce your staff first
thank you mr minister for introducing your staff
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to thank the minister for the information
if there is no request from the communities and one of my communities has hardly anything allocated to it i think there is about 25 thousand dollars for one of my communities
if there is no request from any other communities in nunavut you do not even put it in the budget
you do not even plan it in the budget for a community or something for the community to spend
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as i indicated each department of the government is responsible for putting forward their needs for their department
part of those needs would be what they feel is required throughout the communities of nunavut address the programs and responsibilities within the department
the department of finance and administration co ordinates all the compilation or compiling of that information in developing the budget that comes before the house
therefore if there is a situation during the course of the year where there is an extraordinary need out there in the community then that can be taken into consideration either during the course of the year or the future years planning for budgetary requirements
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
sometimes the budget that is prepared has been changed with the course of the year say for instance to be used for something else that came up
i will just use this as an example there was a budget for 400 thousand for the design of a building
perhaps that 400 thousand was not enough for the design of the building
when ever the budget that has been prepared is going to change how come the regular members do not get informed of a change that is going to occur
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman sometimes as member know we bring supplementary appropriations to the house after the budget is set
that is to reflect any changes that are required
if money that is approved in the assembly for specific projects are requested to move to other projects for whatever reasons that is where it would come back to the house
all members would be able to see what is being proposed and be part of the decision making process have input into that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the budget preparation when we became elected as mlas we figured that the department of education had the funding for my community would have gone ahead
now it has been deferred because it has not had a design put in we were not informed why that was during this session
on april 11 there was a change made and it did not seem to come from the ministers
i just wondered whether the financial management board has the authority to defer an item that was to go ahead
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman normally no we would not defer anything
there might be circumstances surrounding specific projects for whatever reason they could not be delivered in the current year
it is really up to the minister responsible for that to try to follow up and deal with an issue
if it requires financial changes whether if it is additional money or whether it be moving dollars within the department then that particular minister have to come back to the financial management board for that approval
as i indicated earlier it would be part of the supplementary appropriation process which would come back to the house after that financial management board decision
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister ng
mr iqaqrialu do you have any further comments or questions
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
how can you inform us right away because in this example we were not informed right away and it gets frustrating when we do not get information right away because that what happened after you made your decision
they by passed me
i was wondering if your department is going to be doing the same thing the same process in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as i indicated our department of finance and administration is co ordinating for all of the government
i would suggest that certainly from that perspective that we could advise the minister
i am sure most of them take that into consideration of trying to update members as expediently as possible if there are any significant changes to programs that are planned for their communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
comments or questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i know the department is co ordinating the budget development for all the departments
is there any mechanism or something in place for evaluating what is brought forward by the departments just to ensure that everything is in place
i will ask that first in the budget development process and get a response before i move on
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we do have an analytical section within the department of finance and administration
it does analyse specific submissions that come from different departments
i guess in trying to perceive where the member is going with his questioning because it was brought up in the house about departmental programs that were brought forward
i know that the department of finance and administration in developing the first budget and quite frankly the second budget that was before us of the nunavut government have had i would say some involvement but not an extensive involvement in analysing the programs that we assumed first of all from the gnwt and programs that were brought forward again for funding for this current year
it was for new submissions for new programs versus existing ones
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i can appreciate the minister for trying to i guess speculate as to trying to get at with the
what i guess was trying not so much that type of look at things
but i know one of the words that we heard by many of the departments during this past year has been capacity the lack of capacity and that being the reason why we are not getting stuff in this timely manner as we would have liked
i looked at some of the budgets that are presented some of them have it right down to the dollar
the same numbers that were there last year
there are some ways to telling if some departments were having problems or not and trying to identify and assist those department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
would you like to respond mr ng
hon kelvin ng
yeah
thank you mr chairman
i thank the member for his question
yes it was apparent i think trying to meet some of the timelines that the fmbs tried to set out in trying to develop the budget for this current fiscal year
it became quite apparent that some departments were not on an even keel given there was different stages of recruitment for the financing or corporate staffing
in some departments quite frankly needed additional assistance and finance and administration staff did give additional assistance to those departments that required it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman another question in light of the fact there has been tremendous demand and effort put on the under staff public service that we have in just getting the work done
i am wondering under the gnwt there was a role that the department played in the way of monitoring and evaluating government departments to ensure that they are following procedures that are set out by the government the financial administration act
i wondering if that is something i do not see and i do not believe i saw that function appear in the work chart anywhere
i am wondering if they plan to still pursue that or is that going to be a function that is no longer necessary
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
yes it is a function that is required and we have had it
what we are doing is outlined in the current organizational structure
there is a section for corporate controls in there that is where this type of service in assistance will be provided
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman is that going to be a function at the regional or district local level
is that going to be a headquarter function
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it is at the headquarters level
however there are close consultations in the works with the three regional superintendents in the regions
thank you
chairperson interpretation
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
as a headquarter function i guess the role of those people is more of an external
are they going to be doing reviews on just headquarters or will they be going to the regional offices throughout the regional government offices throughout nunavut and conducting those reviews or will it just be something that is done at a headquarters level
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman although it is based at headquarters it does have the responsibilities and the resources that is to assist the outside of headquarters within the regions
in fact it is not available and we do contract out accounting companies with specific work that is required
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
this is an area that i am familiar with
i think it is an important function played by the government
i know a lot of the concerns or issues that usually come to the members of this house s attention or where people the policies and programs of the government were not being followed by the department
so i think this an important thing that we keep track of
i know that there is the audit bureau is also a function under there
it is more of an internal mechanism that will help
again as i said earlier departments do not have the capacity most of the public service out there is going crazy just trying to keep their desks clear and they do not always have free opportunities
many staff are out there doing more than one job
therefore i think again it is an important function that we need to follow
going on to completely something different i guess if no one has any questions
i know based on past experience that the department s do provide quarterly variance reports i am wondering if those variance reports are something our government plans on making available to the public or to the members on a quarterly bases to see we are not caught off guard at the end of the year with either a huge surplus or deficit
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman yes the plan is to do a quarterly variance reports and make them available to the public at large and to members at large to anybody that is interested
i would just want to note that it is all relative i guess on perception but if you look at percentages of the surplus that we anticipate is roughly 5 percent of total government expenditures
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
going back into something else
i was reading the paper the other day and it talked about the public service alliance of canada is about going broke over the pay equity issue
i was wondering how that has any bearing as far as how it is going to affect us as a government
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as you know we are continuing to work with the gnwt as a partner in this pay equity that has been on going
i do not think there is anything new to report in the perspective of there was approximately i think it was 80 percent individual offers to individual employees that have been taken up in signing off on what gnwt proposes settlements to the pay equity dispute and for the remaining 20 percent or so continues to be a process that is on going
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i just know another issue that has been on going for over a year now
the members have raised concerns of the division of assets and liabilities
i was wondering if the minister can provide us with an up date on where things at with that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
i will ask mr vardy to answer that
thank you
mr vardy
mr chairman the work on the division of assets and liability with the gnwt is just about complete
the analysis will show that there is a net gain to nunavut from that exercise
most of the benefits are in the form of non liquid assets
it is receivables from sales of petroleum products to a large extent the power corporation
there is a large quantity of petroleum products that are in the storage tanks throughout the territory
there are some other assets in the form of public buildings
that is quite small
so we will have a positive balance but on the cash side the other assets will result us having to make a payment to the government of the northwest territories
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr vardy
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman if i could apologise to mr vardy could he repeat that last part of the question
i did not quite get his answer
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
i will allow you to state the last part again
mr vardy
what i indicated is the total value of assets will exceed the value of liabilities throughout that process but the large part of the assets are in the form of non cash assets
it is to a large extent petroleum products and receivables from power corporation for petroleum products that are purchased by the government of nunavut
it is quite likely we will have to make a cash payment to the government of the northwest territories to settle the account
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr vardy
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
any idea that cash settlement will be or a rough ballpark figure
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr vardy
mr vardy
mr chairman the value of the settlement could be in the 25 35 million dollar range
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i was wondering that is a lot of money
or a lot of fuel
i am just wondering where those funds would come from
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr vardy
mr vardy
mr chairman the funds would come from the consolidated revenue fund of the government of nunavut but it would not be reflected in the surplus or deficit in any given year
it will affect the balance sheet but not operating or the capital surplus or deficit
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr vardy
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
if it just affects the opening
i guess the bottom line the money has to come from somewhere
if it is not going to affect our operating and capital budget where is the money going to actually come from
chairperson
mr vardy
mr vardy
thank you mr chairman
it s like the health board deficits or any other factor that will effect the finances of nunavut that is not part of the budget within a given time period
we have a cash surplus right now
the net financial position of the government at any given point in time can be different from the expenditures within a given time frame
we have a fairly substantial cash surplus right now because of timing of payments
for example of lot of the transfers from the government of canada are front end loaded
if we weren t in a cash surplus position we would be forced to borrow those funds but we don t see in the foreseeable future any need for borrowing on the part of the government of nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr vardy
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess then the money that we have to pay is going to come out of the funding that we get from the formula funding agreement with the federal government
i don t know if that 25 or 35 million dollars whatever it turns out to be will have at some point in the future a negative impact on the budgets that we develop
because if we only get so much money then that money has to come from somewhere
if that s where the money is coming from then i could see that money that is coming from the federal government how will that effect our budgets and is it something that will be done all at once or spread out over a number of years
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
deputy minister vardy
mr vardy
mr chairman as i have indicated at the beginning of the questioning on this issue we have assets that will more than offset the amount of cash that we will have to spend
some of those there are probably an equal amount roughly 30 million or so in receivables from the power corporation on bills for petroleum products that we have already made that will eventually come into our coffers
there is also the value of all the petroleum products that was sitting in the storage tanks at that point in time
so the net impact on the treasury won t be the value of the cheque that will have to be written to the government of the northwest territories
it should over time be more than offset by the value of those other assets as the benefits flow into the government of nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you deputy minister
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
my question we are negotiating with the nunavut employees  union
how much more is it going to take
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we can t really say right now because there is not collective agreement in principle that has to go out to the employees for ratification and to the financial management board for final approval
they are still in the collective bargaining stages of trying to finalize a new collective agreement
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
i don t have any other names on my list
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
my first question is as the finance department you talk with the federal government and you lobby the federal government to supplement funds for the nunavut government
is that the case
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman we have responsibility for the formula financing agreement which is the main source of funding for the government of nunavut
from that perspective at the official level there are always ongoing discussions
each department each minister of our government also has relationships with their federal counterparts in whatever areas and usually there are opportunities to receive federal funds on programs that will help the government of nunavut in delivering programs and services for our constituents
depending on what is available at the federal level
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
thank you very much for your response
i have another question
the federal government has made reductions to the money that is coming in to us every year
why is that
is it because their financial resources are being depleted every year
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman in fact the revenues from the government of canada have been for this year compared to last year have actually gone up
as i indicated before to the honourable member there is a financial formula financing agreement in place between us and the government of canada for a five year period
so from that perspective the funding is fairly secure for that five year period
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman another area that i would like to ask the minister is in regards to the p3 projects that are going on out there
i am just wondering if you could provide us with a status report on the ones that are where they are at right now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
for the reimbursement for the three birthright corporations sakku qikiqtaaluk and the kitikmeot corporation we have now received the signed reimbursement agreements and have them back to the development corporations
so they can now undertake the work for the planning work that had to be provided as a part of those reimbursement agreements
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i assume the minister is talking about the three regional hospitals that are being worked on
i was just wondering about the nursing station in arviat as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman for the arviat health centre and i thank the member for reminding me they are anticipating that the actual construction will resume again on may 8 which is a week away
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i am just wondering if the department has any other plans for any other such projects in the works that they are looking at or may be looking at in the near future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the only other one that came over in the package from the gnwt where there had been some work was the arctic college facility for cambridge bay
what has happened with that is that the department of education with our department and public works is putting together a request for proposal for interested companies of which the possibility of p3 financing could be one of the options to be reviewed
so that was the only other potential p3 project that we have on the table right now
thank you
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i am just wondering we talked about the arctic college residences i believe that in the past there was in the capital plan some additional student accommodations in the previous budget for iqaluit
i am just wondering if that is being looked at as well
i know iqaluit is going and there are more and more courses being offered at the college and the residences i know right now for example there are a number of students having to stay in some of the older accommodations in town here that aren t specifically for students
i was just wondering if that project is being looked at as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i forgot to mention that
when the whole issue about what to do with the arctic college requirements in the kitikmeot campus came up for discussion there was also the issue about the keewatin and the baffin on exactly what might be required for additional residences or to upgrade the existing residences
so also there is a part of that overall decision in the same departments i had mentioned earlier the department of education on behalf of nunavut arctic college public works and finance and administration were to put together some again what the needs are
to get it to the point of asking for requests for proposals to see what could be undertaken for those two other campuses
at the time we had not identified whether a p3 financing arrangement was going to be one of those options or not
it is not at that stage yet right now it is just to identify what the needs are and to see where to proceed from there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i am just wondering if there are any criteria used or analysis done looking at these projects i know that we have very limited resources that we have to work with and more and more of these types of projects that we take on also uses up our future dollars and furthers limits the resources that we have available to us in the future
are there are any criteria looking at we know we would like to have this but it is just something that over in the department of education is doing a twenty year plan
these types of things may have to wait their turn and come up where they fall within that twenty year plan if it s an education facility or not or whether it would go and move ahead sooner as a p3 project
so i am wondering if there is any criteria for deciding on that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there would be from the perspective of all these decisions having to come back for financial management board review
but also i guess from the perspective of there seems to be a move from the public accounting leaders in respect to trying to change the way public accounting government accounting for assets for long term assets
in the past governments have been required to charge all the expenditures in the year in which they outlay the expenditure the cash
that s why the capital plans come forward in the legislature
but the move is to allow to change the guidelines to allow governments to amortise their capital investments over the life expectancy of those assets similar to what private enterprise has available to them right now from that depreciation aspect
so that s one major change that is making its  way through the public accounting sector right now that could have an impact or will have an impact on the government accounting procedures and government expenditures in the future
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i guess hearing that it would make it all the more critical that we do have some type of criteria or standard to roughly choose to go ahead on that matter if we are going to be allowed to a lot more easily get into these types of arrangements we could look at one project for example that could have an impact on the government probably long after we are gone
if we get into too many of these we really have to be cautious in this area
we are basically mortgaging our future
we are spending dollars with some of these arrangements that go over the life span of the building which is over 25 or 30 years then we are spending money that 25 or 30 years from now that the government of the day and our children won t have to deal with
so i guess i would really want to see some type of criteria developed that would say whether it is worthwhile for us to do that in entering these types of agreements prior to any of these agreements being approve like that
because it could have a huge impact on the future governments of nunavut
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman there is a quite detailed analysis of this mr chairman alternative form of financing i understand
one of the key criteria the emphasis on value for money because i recognize that there are long term implications and ongoing operating costs as a factor as well with the capital construction costs
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
on these management agreements or p3 projects has the department set up or developed a set of policies or procedures that govern the management of these yet or not
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman as i have indicated in the past we do have draft policies and procedures that haven t been formally adopted yet
unfortunately because of other issues and other priorities it hasn t got to the cabinet or financial management board decision level yet
but we expect to have that done in shortly after we are finished with our budget session
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman will the standing committee or the regular members be able to have any input on those prior to them being approved
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would say that at the first available opportunity i would provide those policies and procedures to the standing committee
right now i can t commit to having it to them before the financial management board or before cabinet has had a chance to review it
they would certainly have to review it in advance so it can go to one of the standing committees
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister ng
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
yes i know it would probably have to come to us in a draft form for the committee to review
i guess once it is all said and done and the policy is completed and they are set up and approved is that something that would be that the government would make public as well
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman yes
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
i do not have any more names
first we will deal with the capital estimates
we do not have any capital estimates
we will go to the main estimates

total operations and maintenance i will begin from the beginning
department of finance and administration branch summary directorate operations and maintenance
total operations and maintenance 867 thousand
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i note under the directorate and just to get this clarified is last year there was 87 thousand dollars in contract services and it is down 50 thousand dollars this year
i am just wondering if that is services that were contracted back to the gnwt or where they were is that something that we are doing now
i am just wondering why there is that difference of 50 thousand
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman no generally there has just been a decrease in the requests for contract services
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman mr chairman as well there is also a big increase in the computer hardware and software
is that again i know that i talked about it before new programs and stuff like that or is that just new computers for that area
it wasn t staffed before they didn t have the equipment and now they are planning to get staff in there that they need more equipment or what
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
no mr chairman generally it is just a 14 thousand dollar increase for that budget item
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i was going to ask a question in regards to the computers
perhaps when we reach that item i will ask my question at that time
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
i did not hear a question
we are on page 3   4
total operations and maintenance 867 thousand
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman i would like to ask a question under contract services
are there any services contracted back to the gnwt and would they show up through here in directorate or are they somewhere else in the budget
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman no all the finance and administrative functions that were contracted to the gnwt as of april 1 we assumed responsibility we resumed responsibility for those services that we had contracted out
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
we will go on to total operations and maintenance 867 thousand are you agreed
some members

mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
in this area again looking at the details provided to the standing committee there is a substantial increase in travel and transportation
why is there such as an increase
has the function changed or has something been re allocated
what is the big difference
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
the travel and transportation is primarily as a result of any additional requirements needed because of the capital budgeting
the development of the capital budget sorry the 5 year draft of the capital plan
that is why we have had some provisions in case there was some inquiries in that area
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i would just note that the contract services were dropped by almost 500 thousand dollars
were those services that we had contracted back to the gnwt or was that something else
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman the bulk of the decrease here is really a transfer within departments because of the p3 planning funding of approximately 500 thousand dollars was moved over to corporate services from this section
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
i would just ask the question there two lines down on the other expenses it goes from 11 million dollars to 20 thousand
is that the same type of thing
something has been re allocated to a different location in the budget
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
yes the member is correct there was 1 million dollars of this moved to the business development corporation for start up funding that was under this section in prior years
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you
going back to total operations and maintenance 1 million 687 thousand dollars
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
here it states the canadian and nunavut tax policies and the administration of tax collection processes
so this one is for taking taxes out of nunavut
is that what it is
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr chairman
he is correct in that this is the section where those responsibilities come under the jurisdiction of the department
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
last year we expended 3 million dollars and the previous 2 million 976 thousand
it has gone down by quite a bit
perhaps it is because of the federal government and nunavut government splitting the tax collections
thank you mr chairman
