this training will also continue in 2000 2001 as required
the department of justice is having all bills translated into inuktitut and innuinaqtun as well as other core justice materials
the financial management board approved the expenditure in 2000 2001 of 150 thousand dollars
this is to cover the cost of hiring two inuktitut translators
one translator has been hired and the hiring process for the second is underway now
the department does not have the capacity to translate into innuinaqtun but relies on the assistance of the department of culture language elders and youth to do this
summaries of the over two hundred statutes in force in nunavut have been prepared in inuktitut and english
this is the first time such a project has been undertaken in canada and perhaps the world
these initiatives are important as we change our laws to better suit nunavummiut
interpretation ends the nunavut legal services board is in the final stages of becoming operational
the headquarters will be located in gjoa haven
an executive director has been hired and is now in gjoa haven he has now hired three staff from the community of gjoa haven
our start date of april 1 for the legal services board has been adjusted so that we can be sure the gjoa haven office is ready and that staff members are in place
we have therefore extended our agreement with the gnwt by three months until the end of june
the functions of the nunavut legal services board will be run by the nwt legal services board until june 30 when the nunavut legal services board will take over management of the provision of legal aid services to nunavummiut
the nunavut legal registries office is operating in yellowknife and will be relocated to iqaluit as soon as office space is available this fall
the financial management board has approved funds to develop an electronic filing and data maintenance system called the personal property security registry
we are planning that this system will be in place when the new personal property security act is brought into force
we are also proposing changes to modernise the land titles system in nunavut
both these developments will help to make the registry system more user friendly to nunavummiut by reducing delays and costs
you will see in your materials that the budget for the department of justice is broken down into two main categories
first operations and maintenance and then the capital plan
in your review of the main estimates you will see on page 5 3 that our operations and maintenance budget totals 36 million 537 thousand
this is broken down as follows
compensation and benefits 10855000
grants and contributions  1343000
other expenses 24339000
operations and maintenance funds are allocated to the various functions within the department    directorate law enforcement legal services board lawyer support services registries and court services and community justice and corrections
the single largest item in the budget is the nunavut policing contract with the rcmp at 13 million 964 thousand dollars
interpretation as you will also see on page 5 3 the department of justice has a small capital budget totalling 600 thousand dollars
of this amount 310 thousand dollars is for improvements at the baffin correctional centre and 100 thousand dollars is for outpost camps
additional capital funding will be required in the future if we are going to follow the recommendations of the corrections planning committee and repatriate our offenders to nunavut from other institutions
in the coming year we will be working hard to stay within the allocated budget we are setting priorities and making every effort to ensure that we operate as effectively as possible on those priorities
we are working hard to develop new ways to deal with justice issues   ways that will meet the needs and aspirations of nunavummiut whatever we do we try very hard to base our actions on the principles of inuit qaujimajatuqangit
i am interested in ideas you may have about how we can build a stronger justice system we are now available to answer questions you have about the main estimates for the department of justice
mr chairman i am pleased to be able to make some opening remarks as we begin the debate on the 20002001 main estimates for the department of justice over the past year the standing committee has had an opportunity to meet with the minister on a number of occasions
mr chairman over the past year the standing committee has emphasised the need for a community and healing based approach to justice issues we are pleased that the department s business plan expresses this commitment to building a justice system that is reflective of the needs of nunavummiut in this regard
we have taken note of the 450 thousand dollars in new funding that the department has allocated to its new community supervision plan members are hopeful that this plan will benefit as many communities as possible
however we have noted that the total 20002001 om spending for the community corrections and justice branch of the department has actually decreased slightly from 19992000
over the coming year the standing committee will take a special interest in reviewing the way in which the department will put into action the recommendations contained in the report of the corrections planning committee
it will monitor with interest departmental progress in negotiating a new diversion protocol with the rcmp cjcs and the federal department of justice
we look forward to the minister updating us on these initiatives throughout the coming year
we will also be paying attention to the progress of the decentralization of the legal services board to gjoa haven
finally mr chairman the standing committee has taken note of some new capital initiatives of the department
these include 100 thousand dollars in funding for correction camps on the land camps have been something that we have been supportive of throughout the past year
fifty thousand dollars has been allocated for planning for a new adult correctional facility we will be taking a great interest in which community this facility is placed
finally we have noted 50 thousand dollars for planning for a new courthouse
some members on the standing committee had the opportunity to tour the existing facility with the minister here in iqaluit
mr chairman these are some of the general areas of concern that we have had as a standing committee

arctic science summit
hon james arvaluk thank you mr speaker
the nunavut research institute a part of arctic college in conjunction with several agencies of the federal government have been successful in attracting next year s arctic science summit to canada
it will be held in iqaluit during the week of april 22 to the 27 2001
this meeting will attract over two hundred arctic circumpolar world s top research people including formal delegations from all circumpolar countries and representatives of many circumpolar people
this will have positive economic benefits for iqaluit and the nunavut economy
it will also provide nunavut with the opportunity to have input directly into the circumpolar research agenda
we can present to the circumpolar community many of the issues and concerns affecting science research in nunavut
interpretation one such issue is the impact of climate change on the people of nunavut and the proposed meeting will provide an excellent opportunity to build on the initiative outlined recently in the legislature by my colleague peter kilabuk the minister for sustainable development
the meetings are generally self funded with support forthcoming from the federal agencies involved
an organising committee of community the nunavut government and federal sponsoring agencies is currently being struck
i will keep members informed as arrangements for this event are finalized

liberal mp nancy karetak lindell the chairperson joe ohokannoak and the president johnny kusugak of nunavut arctic college and mayor keith peterson were also present and participated in the ceremony
premier okalik was the guest speaker and turnout to the event was excellent
there was a broad range of programs from which graduates were recognized
these programs included adult basic education general education diploma preparation computer specialist certificate environmental technology diploma programs jewellery metal work diploma program job readiness life skills program management studies certificate diploma program and the social work diploma program
mr speaker graduates and participants their families and instructors should be congratulated and commended for the efforts and achievements i know that they have and will continue to make valuable contributions to the future success of our new territory
the nunavut arctic college student council and the management studies group presented the mayor with 2 cheques totalling 1 thousand 3 hundred dollars from their own fund raising activities
they were adding this contribution to the contribution fund for the gymnasium
once again mr speaker this shows the commitment the community and the region has towards this important project
mr speaker following the graduation ceremonies there was a public meeting sponsored by the hamlet to address the kiilinik high school project
this was attended by elders students teachers heritage society representative and members of the public
mr speaker the premier and i along with our colleagues and yourself included also attended
we once again heard of the importance of the project to the community and to the kitikmeot

hon kelvin ng

at this time i want to thank my honourable colleagues in this house for recognising part of the needs and aspirations of cambridge bay and the kitikmeot residents with the approval of the education budget which included funding for the full size gymnasium
i sincerely hope mr speaker members will be as open minded in review of the culture language elders  youth budget which contains funding to allow for the much needed and desired cultural heritage centre to proceed
mr speaker another event which was worked into our busy schedule was the opening of the new nunavut government s office building which the nunavut construction corporation built
this event took place prior to the graduation ceremonies and was widely attended by members of the community
earlier that morning mr speaker the premier and i along with our staff held a meeting with the senior managers in the regional office to review the first year of operations and identify and issues arising out of that first year
again i believe this was successful in providing a forum for open exchange of information between our senior managers and ourselves
finally on a sunday morning we met with the mayor and the deputy mayor kugaaruk along with their mla mr alakannuark on their proposed school project and the concern that they have surrounding that project
prior to our departure the premier and i also had an opportunity to tour the wellness centre and receive some information on the child development program
overall mr speaker it was a very busy day and a half
i noted that the students and the members of the public were very appreciative of our taking time to tend to these events in the community and i think it is also important that we showed our support to the nunavut arctic college student graduates
in closing mr speaker i would like to thank the many organisers of these events the residents for their gracious hospitality extended to us and finally i wish to thank the premier and my colleagues mr havioyak  mr alakannuark and mr puqiqnak for taking the time out of your weekend to participate in these events in cambridge bay

proper facilities for all communities
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr speaker
today i am very pleased to rise to talk about the importance of education and its benefits to the people of nunavut
we all expect that we will be providing for the needs that we have in our communities so that these plans will become reality
i believe that we should proceed with our sessions and make information available so that we can treat all the communities of nunavut equally
mr speaker when we discuss the important issues such as the needs and having the proper facilities in nunavut
we should have all those proper facilities in our communities for our future generations
they outweigh our concerns today because we have to make way for our future
all our facilities should be proper and safe
if we focus on one issue too much we won t be making proper decisions mr speaker
as nunavut as a whole we would like to have a proper future and we should have proper facilities for our children
regular members along with the cabinet members have to work closely together for the sake of our younger generations
so we will make proper plans and resolve the conflicts and concerns we do face

cost of air travel
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker today i have a major concern in regards to airfares
mr speaker members have been asking questions to the government and we made statements in regards to the airfares
mr speaker today i will be asking questions during question period to the minister responsible for transportation and mr speaker i will be tabling some documents
mr speaker the airfares if i was to come from sanikiluaq it would cost 3 thousand 662 dollars
if i was coming from grise fiord it would cost 2 thousand 648 dollars
mr speaker at the point of this coming weekend if i was to travel from here to down south or somebody down south came here it would be 99 dollars on a special rate for iqaluit to ottawa as a weekend fair and we cannot take advantage of that
mr speaker 499 dollars for a canadian airfare for a special rate from iqaluit to ottawa
that is more than what it costs from grise fiord to iqaluit and during question period i will be asking the minister of transportation on why this is this way

infrastructure for smaller communities
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to make a statement on an issue that has been a concern of mine from my constituency for quite some time
my constituents and community have written letters and tabled petitions to lobby for more money for use in the communities
mr speaker we have heard that there was going to be a big gym built in a particular community attached to the school twenty percent of it will be raised by the community and it will be the centre of that region
this gymnasium will be used by the people in that region
they have a lot of companies in that region and they would be able to lobby for some money for the larger gymnasium they will be receiving
mr speaker they should have some ability to collect some money from the private companies
mr speaker this is one of the concerns that i have had and i have raised it in the house for quite some time because i feel the smaller communities should be given the advantage of getting projects done in their community as well
just like any other community has been receiving
it seems like the larger communities get more projects that the smaller communities
the smaller communities should be able to get the same thing

in response to mr nutarak s question on eligibility for school gymnasiums

for example
a school with less than 88 students would not be eligible for a gym
a school with 132 students would also not qualify for a gym if there is an alternative recreational facility in the community that is a community hall that is used for recreational purposes
a school with an enrolment of between 133 396 would be eligible for a small gymnasium   396 square metres
a school with a design of 397 and above would be eligible for a large gym or full sized   527 square metres a schoolcommunity requesting a gym when enrolments are below the accepted capital and standards and criteria require ministerial and cabinet permission

question 491   13
lottery licences
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is for the minister of justice
mr speaker i would like to know how the department issues lottery licences to communities
if i was to apply for a lottery licence how would i go about it
this is not for the sake of myself mr speaker for my colleagues as well
since they will need to know to obtain lottery licences
i understand we as members of the legislative assembly must support the hamlets by way of letter attached to their application for lottery licence and if they want a lottery licence how would they go about doing it
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister for justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think they sort of go together like the bingo and lottery licences the member is asking about
i am sorry there are two types of licences
the community can apply for a licence and if you do not have an application you can go to my department and ask for an application
they can fill out an application depending which licence you would like to obtain
as long as the community does not break the law we can approve the licence
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr anawak

we will know where to send it
in the future will let the public know exactly where you can obtain a licence for lottery and we could always directed to whoever deals with the licences

cost of airfares
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i made a statement in regards to airfares earlier

deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister of transportation mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
when i replied to the member for amittuq i mentioned that we are doing a review on airfares and i mentioned here in the house recently that the review should start soon and that they will finish in october
i replying to the member from amittuq i will just use this as an example that we live in the high arctic in grise fiord or resolute bay
these are not the only communities that are paying high prices for their airfare
we realise that airfares are really high
i cannot respond to the member because i do not have the information right now
we will be reviewing this to see how we can best address the high cost of airfares and because we do not deal with air carriers we will have to do a review on that first before i can respond to the member properly
i will do a review as to why they charge so much for airfare
we will be doing this review and i feel that this is an urgent matter and i will give a reply to the member as soon as i can

gjoa haven fuel situation
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the member for nattilik had asked a question about petroleum products problem in gjoa haven
there has been bad gasoline for the past winter
i would like to direct my question to the minister of public works
what are you doing now about the bad fuel situation
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker i would like to thank you mr speaker you have been very good in dealing with the concerns of your constituents and you kept them informed about the gas situation and approaching me to resolve the problems you have encountered in gjoa haven
to answer the question and to thank the member for tunnuniq i can say that this coming weekend we will be bringing gas to gjoa haven for the use of skidoos and they will be provided with gas year around for skidoos and other vehicles
therefore the concern of the tunnuniq mla will be resolved
i would like to wish all the people of gjoa haven a good easter and first air will be bringing gas to gjoa haven right away for the use of skidoos because they have run out of gas at this time
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
on the same question about the gjoa haven gasoline
as you have stated that this gasoline is going to be used for the snowmobiles what about the outboard motors

thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
minister for public works ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes the fuel that we will be delivering is going to be good enough to be used for outboard motors
we are working to resolve the concern of that community and i would also like to thank my staff for working on this every time i ask them to work especially the superintendent brent boddy who lives in cambridge bay and went to gjoa haven to review the gasoline situation every time they start experiencing that he is always there ready and available to go to the community
i would also like to thank the mayor
the gasoline or the fuel will be good enough to use for outboard motors

mr tootoo
question 495   13
cost of flying in fuel
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for petroleum products
the minister just indicated that the department will be flying in fuel to gjoa haven and i am glad that is happening
maybe just wondering is i can imagine can i ask the minister what the costs are going to be as a result of having to fly in that fuel
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
the bottom line was that the community needed fuel and we had to address the situation
i don t have the dollar figures for this
i know it is going to cost money but the community needed the fuel and we had to do it with this strategy of bringing it in by first air
i can get that information for the member and give it to him or through you as the member for that riding mr speaker
thank you
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe the minister said that it s as a result of bad gas that is there that is not good
the costs that the department is going to have to incur to fly in good gas will there be any way of recouping that cost
is there any way of going back on the supplier of the gasoline and finding out at some point where and who is responsible for providing bad gasoline to the government
if there is a supplier is there some type of warranty or guarantee on the quality of product and a way of recouping some of those costs
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
we have never said as a department that the gas was bad gas
that fuel is on spec and can be consumed during the warmer months but the community has said that it is not on spec according to their knowledge their skidoos seem to be having problems and so we are trying to address it as best we can because that s what the community has asked us to do
however according to our tests we have never said that it was bad gas because according to our tests it is on spec
we are using the fuel for trucks and hondas that old gas but the community has said that they wanted better fuel for their skidoos
that is why we are addressing this problem
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
oral questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker mr speaker based on what the minister is saying if any community is not satisfied with the petroleum products that they get then they could do the same thing
i think that just on spec if the fuel isn t good i would hope that the government wouldn t incur those extra costs for no reason
i think by sending in better fuel it is an indication that there is something wrong with the fuel that is there
i am just wondering if the plans are to provide and have that fuel tested to see if there is actually something wrong with it
i would think that any fuel should be able to be used at any time of the year not just fuel for the summer and fuel for the winter
my understanding of gas is that gas is gas and you use it whenever
is there going to be some kind of a test to see if there is a quality problem for the fuel or not
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
we spent over i couldn t tell you exactly how much but i am pretty sure it was over 50 thousand to test that fuel
according to our spec list the fuel is on spec
i have tabled all those documents here but we are listening to the people of gjoa haven
we are listening to the people and to the community they want gas for their skidoos separately and we are doing the best we can to address that situation
i have already tabled all the tests on that fuel
this is what the community wished us to do and according to their inuit knowledge that s what they said they would want us to do
so we are doing the best we can and we have been talking to the community and also to the mla yourself mr speaker and if the member wants me to dig out all that information again i could show them
but i have already done what i can to test the fuel in gjoa haven
we have concluded that if the community wants that for that specific reason then we have done the best we can to address the situation
that doesn t mean that we are doing that for everybody else in the territory
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i appreciate the work that the department has done to accommodate the needs of the community
again i would just ask the minister indicated it is something that they will not be doing for all the communities
if another community runs into this type of a situation would the department be willing to look at the concerns if they happen to be raised by another community as well
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
the process for gjoa haven to get to this situation took about a year of testing of going back to the community going back and forth
so if there were a problem with somebody s gas we would have to go through the whole process again which would probably take sometimes over a year to do some testing
this was a problem raised by the community a concern raised by a community since the last government
so this is the solution we have come up with for gjoa haven
thank you mr speaker

minister of health  social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker first i would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for the question and also for the good work that he has done on behalf of the community of kugluktuk as an advocate
mr speaker the department of health  social services has decentralized offices from headquarters in rankin inlet
we are also mr speaker in the midst of finalizing the numbers for the decentralization of the regional offices into pang
mr speaker also the decentralization of headquarters positions into kugluktuk
the delay over the past few months the member has been asking these questions to me privately and so on has been the number of jobs and what positions we relocate
working with the member and i still make that commitment mr speaker as the premier has that we are committed to decentralization and we will be moving the ten positions to kugluktuk and we are hoping to be able to do it as soon as possible we are identifying hopefully over the next couple of weeks firming up the number of positions and what those positions are
mr speaker we are trying to make sure that those positions are positions that can be filled within the community of kugluktuk
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you minister picco
oral questions
mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understand that it is a couple of weeks
i would like to know exactly what you mean by a couple of weeks i feel that a couple of weeks become a couple of months
i would like to seek an answer because kugluktuk would like to know
what do you mean by a couple of weeks
thank you
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
minister for health  social services mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker indeed i am not able to say if it is two weeks or three weeks
of course as the member knows if we are trying to hire in that community we would have to advertise the positions
we would have to have that information before we would actually be able to hire
we would have to go out and we would have to recruit
what i am hoping to do mr speaker is the actual hiring of people from kugluktuk
i don t necessarily want to just move people and bodies from headquarters to kugluktuk
i would rather have positions that are not filled at the present time and fill them with people from kugluktuk which is what the member and indeed when i was in kugluktuk last summer what the people of kugluktuk had indicated
so that s why the delay mr speaker on the actual when the jobs will be in place
i can commit to the member that over the next couple of days while the member is in town or when he comes back next week we will sit down with my officials from the department of health  social services to iron out an exact time that we will be able to move forward on the hiring of the positions
but it will be over the next several weeks mr speaker thank you
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you minister picco
member for kugluktuk
mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
also thank you to the minister
i have been saying this many times that we are getting tired of waiting also for the jobs that will be filled i would like to know exactly here in the house exactly when you are going to put out the advertisements to fill the jobs in kugluktuk
i would like to know exactly when you will be putting them out
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker over the past 12 months in the department of health  social services we have been trying to ascertain what positions we would move to kugluktuk and mr speaker there have been some suggestions that have come forward that i have talked to the member about
for example the repatriation of patients in the south would i put a facility in kugluktuk to accommodate that
mr speaker we were looking at other positions within headquarters
would i move for example epidemiology to kugluktuk and an epidemiologist
those positions may not be able to be filled in kugluktuk
earlier this week mr speaker i mentioned in this house that we had a briefing on the new travel policy that i am hoping to bring forward to the cabinet and then mr speaker to the government
in that travel policy there is an opportunity where i would be looking at setting up a decentralized office which would give me the positions in kugluktuk
that is the direction that we are moving in right now mr speaker so i can t say exactly when to the member
as the premier has said as this government has said as i have said as the minister for the department of health  social services we will move positions to kugluktuk and i am trying to move positions where i can fill those positions in kugluktuk
i would rather do that than put people into kugluktuk as the member had stated
so because of that i cannot say when that will happen
what i can say is that it will be over the next couple of weeks
we will be able to come back to the member give him a firm date and give him the positions so that the people in kugluktuk will have an opportunity to apply for those positions mr speaker
because that is the whole idea of decentralization of this government is to bring jobs into communities not necessarily to transplant people into communities
that s what we are trying to accomplish and that may take a little bit more time but mr speaker at the end of the day that would be a better plan i think not only for the people of kugluktuk but for the people of nunavut
because that s the whole principle behind decentralization
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you minister picco
mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
thank you very much for your answer
i am sure that there will be many people that will be interested
as you stated that you would like to get people from kugluktuk to take over the jobs this is very good to hear and i am sure that there will be training
i am sure that there will be people that will be willing to train
are you going to be having any kind of training for these people
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker under the auspices of the good offices of the premier he has set up as the member knows the decentralization secretariat that is looking at the aspects of logistics and the administrative aspects of decentralization
one of the things that i would commit to the members is that if we are going to move jobs from the department of health  social services into kugluktuk we are going to hire people in kugluktuk
that may mean giving on the job training and providing that type of assistance
mr speaker i make that commitment to the member that we will as a department put that type of training in place
whether it be a formalised academic training program or i think mr speaker probably it would be some kind of ojt or on the job training so that at the end of the day people in kugluktuk benefit from the decentralization of jobs to nunavut
something similar to what we are trying to accomplish with the power corporation in baker lake

minister for health  social services
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think in all honesty one of the frustrating things of being a minister and indeed i think for all the government of nunavut has been some of the concerns that we have had in recruitment
mr speaker as i have tried to relate in this house over the past few months and give credit where credit is due mr speaker the member of kimmirut and cape dorset has repeatedly brought up the concern of kimmirut for a social worker
i have had several conversations with the mayor of kimmirut
we had thought earlier about six weeks ago that we had a person
we had gone through the interview process we had made the job offer and at the last moment the person turned down the offer of social work for kimmirut
one of the problems with kimmirut as the member knows is housing
we have now secured housing so we have gone back out to re advertise the position to get the social worker position in kimmirut
mr speaker this not a unique case
we are short social workers in other communities and we are trying to recruit for those communities
we do know that we have the benefit of several people who are now graduating from social work in igloolik who may want to take on a position in one of our communities
that may be a opportunity and in the mean time all i can tell the member is that i have requested and i know that my department is working very hard to try and fill the position of social worker in kimmirut
again after the session today i will make inquiries at the department of health  social services to see where we are in staffing the position in kimmirut

question 498   13
changes to minimum wage
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be directing my question to the minister of finance
interpretation ends the poverty line translates into a minimum wage of 10 dollars an hour
minimum wage is way bellow that in nunavut and the cost of living is much higher than in the rest of canada
when will the changes be made to the minimum wage rate in nunavut to more accurately reflect the living costs in nunavut
deputy speaker interpretation

my question today is for the minister of finance
i wonder if the minister of finance could answer me this question
the regional offices in the baffin kivalliq and the kitikmeot the regional directors i think they are still called or superintendents
what is their maximum spending authority
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you minister of finance
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
the honourable member is good at asking me questions that i do not have the full details on
i will have to get back on this specific matter and report
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you your question is taken as notice
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
the reason that i wanted to ask the question and i m sure that he will get back to me because he is really good at it
there are communities that have initiated community empowerment so when they take on added responsibility then comes the financial requirements to run the municipalities that were set years and years and years ago by the old territorial government of 150 thousand per superintendent
i m sure with the cost of living and community empowerment and additional pressures put on the superintendent or directors that they shouldn t have to go to the deputy minister every time they need to buy a case of toilet paper or javex or various other things like rubber boots
could the honourable minister re evaluate what the spending authority is for superintendents and let me know
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr mclean
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i thought the member was speaking directly about the regional superintendents of finance in respect to his question
but he is obviously referring to superintendents of different departments and i don t have the specifics
that is a very detailed question and maybe more properly addressed as a written question
i will undertake to provide that information
however i will say that each department is different
it depends on the departmental structure and what each deputy minister authorises for their directors and on down

question 500   13
motorised wheelchair status
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct my question to the minister of health and social services
last year when we were first elected i had asked a question in regards to disabled persons in the community about a motorised wheelchair
we have been anticipating that motorised wheelchair for the longest time
we have been waiting to receive that wheelchair for over a month
so my question is when are you going to be providing that motorised wheelchair
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to thank the member for his question
as the member knows i have met with the individual here in iqaluit and helped him arrange a wheelchair for him while he was in iqaluit while he was attending the council for the disabled
at that time mr speaker the regional health board through the hospital had ordered a motorised wheelchair as the member had stated
they had said at that time it would be 3 6 months
i don t have the current briefing note or the current information provided to me to suggest otherwise
what i will have to do mr speaker is at the end of this question period today is get the information for the member for when the motorised wheelchair will be arriving for the individual in question in clyde river

question 501   13
social services vacant positions
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker i will direct in my question to the minister of finance
i have been seeing a problem in my colleague mr akesuk s riding and also it occurred in clyde river when they could not fill the positions for some time but my colleague s social service worker position has been vacant for well over a year
i had asked a question when we first elected about the job opportunities being advertised and how you would be hiring people who are fully qualified for social services
the staff we are hiring must be all certified is that always going to be the case
thank you mr speaker
deputy speaker interpretation
mr minister
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
it depends on the program and what that employee has
the responsibility for the situation of a social worker there are some statutory requirements and proper procedures and protocol that require a certain level of certification
when you are dealing with issues that involve courts and families within communities there are certain levels of experience and expertise required

although you replied to me before your response was if an inuk person is capable of doing that job they will be hired
elders are very capable counsellors and even more so than the qualified people although even if you are educated you need experience so you will really know
we have very certified counsellors although they are not certified and they should be hired
thank you mr speaker

hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i recognise what the honourable member is saying and counselling is one aspect of what a social worker s duties are
there is a multitude of other factors as well
we are trying to address this more on a longer term basis through nunavut arctic college through the social worker programs that we are providing
we need enough of a broad base for individuals to enter that profession
in the long term of course we will cultivate our own people to occupy those positions
thank you mr speaker

general comment
i have been asking the minister and i will be asking for a response
some of the jps cannot even read english
i have been asking the minister of justice if they have to use the justice of the peace at the community level
chairperson interpretation
i forgot to mention that we are dealing with the department of justice
minister anawak and your officials if you would like to go to the witness table
you may do so now so that mr barnabas may ask his questions
thank you mr anawak
could you introduce your officials please

general comments and questions
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes
as i have stated before i have asked the minister numerous times in regards to the justices of the peace
some of them cannot even read english and there are unilingual speaking people and they have to be assisted by the rcmp when they charge somebody
the jp has to abide by the regulations that are set forth and i know that they are only in english currently
they still have not been translated
i have asked the minister if they will be translated
i am just wondering what the status of this is now
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
yes i thought we were just going to go straight to general comments
at this point the justices of the peace are now being trained and i know that we are now trying to get the summaries of statutes translated and the regulations
however if they have not already been translated they will be translated and neil sharkey who is responsible for that it is evident that he will proceed to work on these
i know that the actual summaries of statutes are not translated into inuktitut the ones that we inherited from the gnwt if they are not already translated they will be translated
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you
i am just reiterating the question that was asked before
the justices of the peace when they do their work they are paid an honorarium of 40 dollars
are you going to increase that rate because they have to deal with social issues and the justices of the peace do have an impact on the people who have been charged and going to court
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you
i know that as we work on the issue of justices of the peace it is evident that we will start training them
as we proceed with the training we have not considered their honorarium rate but it is evident that as we progress with the training program that we will start working with the justices of the peace
at this point i am sure that i could say that as we proceed with the training program we will ask neil sharkey to review the rate that is paid to the jps
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
any other general comments
mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have spoken to the minister himself personally and i would like to ask him a question
in the communities we would like to see a correctional centre within nunavut where the people get help
when people are sent outside of the community for example to edmonton when they have to be incarcerated and when they have been away from home for a long time they start losing their self esteem
for example when they come back to the communities i know in kugluktuk and you also know when a person is incarcerated it is very difficult for the people and i feel that there should be more correctional centres closer to home within nunavut
i believe that we could have a better future when we are actually with our own people
we have to make sure that these people are using their culture they are away from their culture when they have to go elsewhere to be incarcerated
i feel that when they have to go down south they leave their culture and language behind and there should be healing for these people because they need it
i am seeking support from the minister himself and i am making sure that this is known publicly because it is very important to the people of my riding
for example it is not only kugluktuk it is all over nunavut that it is getting very difficult for many people
it changes their lifestyle this is our own culture and heritage and it gets very difficult for people who have to be incarcerated outside of nunavut
i feel that it is very important that we should start having more places where people could be healed
we all know it is right in front of us that we are losing good people people that have knowledge
i feel that there should be a place where people could be taught that there is a brighter future than they have now
i feel that this is very important to the people of nunavut
this is a concern within my riding and i feel that we could have a better future if we start having places like that within our own communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
if you can understand his question
it is mostly a comment
mr anawak if you could reply
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes we understand his concern
the people that go down south to serve their sentences and back in nunavut they usually go to yellowknife to be incarcerated
we have noticed that there are a lot of them that have committed crimes and they have to be sent down south to be incarcerated and their way of living changes drastically when they come back home
one of the problems is because their relatives cannot go and visit them because it is too expensive to go down south
just as an example the people that have spent time in a penitentiary they can get visits from their relatives
however inuit that go down to a federal penitentiary are not visited very often by their relatives and they cannot stay for any length of time when they go to visit
for this reason we are trying to look at ways to get some funding from the federal government to see whether we can build a maximum security facility in nunavut
i know there is already a correctional centre here in iqaluit but it is not very big
we feel that if there is no other correctional facility over here it would be better and staff at the department of justice have worked with this and i will be meeting with the solicitor general of canada in the near future
i already had a meeting with him this winter and perhaps we can talk to him about this during the meeting that i will have with him in the near future
yes to the member s question or comment kugluktuk has wanted a correctional facility in their hometown or in the kitikmeot region
at this time we are looking for some funding from the federal government
the solicitor general is not with justice so i am not sure how to put it into inuktitut
i will be meeting with him in the near future to talk about the concern of the member
because we have our own territory now i will be asking him if we can get funding to build a facility
the kind of facility we want and the location also has to be reviewed
i feel for the member s comment and his riding has written us a letter to build a facility in kugluktuk but at this time we cannot say what we might be doing
i will meet again with lawrence macauley the solicitor general for canada and when i get some information as to the money that we might receive we hope to get some money but we don t know how much it would be and when it would be so i just wanted to make that comment
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
sometime in the near future maybe could we get just a little more accurate timeline
maybe a month three months a year down the road
just do you have any idea when you say the near future
just for my information koanna
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak thank you mr chairman
the staff is working at getting together a meeting between the solicitor general s staff and our staff here at justice in about 10 days within 10 days
shortly after that they will be working at getting a meeting between the solicitor general and myself so i would hope that we would have a meeting within the next three weeks with the minister and from there be able to report i hope some kind of progress on looking for some funding for a correctional facility in nunavut
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak i do not have any names on my list at this time
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i was just falling asleep
just to elaborate on mr havioyak s comment or question
it seems like these people are sort of left behind and the women are treated a lot better
some communities have had that concern for the men to be given more fair treatment just like the women inmates in regards to healing
i would like to ask the minister if they could have more healing sessions for men
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr anawak hon jack anawak interpretation
the treatment programs are usually in another division completely because if a person is interested in treatment and healing what we want to do is have it initiated by the community while we are support people we would be more than happy to encourage the communities to ask for our support but they are the ones that have to initiate the healing and treatment programs and trying to help their inmates adjust
this concerns inmates when they return to their communities after they have been in corrections it seems that all they get is welcome back i think there should be some aftercare because welcoming a person back and not doing anything to help them does not really contribute to correcting one s mistakes or lifestyles
when a person has been through the court and jail system he seems to be just dropped off as soon as he gets out of jail and i think there should be some proper treatment or healing programs they should have some counselling provided to them by way of interviewing and things like that because they seem to have no other place to go once they have been through the justice system
i think there should be some follow up because the women inmates seem to get all the help that they need however if you look at this in the future although i was interested in starting up a program i would probably have to raise some funds for healing programs for our male inmates
sometimes their family members are no longer around they lose their house and their equipment and their property and i know that there is no form of assistance given to ex inmates the social workers are responsible to take care of these inmates that are coming home and they have on top of that the responsibility for example if a guy beats up his wife the social worker has to work with the offender and the victim at the same time
that s why this winter we will establish four new positions if we are able to get more funding in the next fiscal year we would like to see more positions open all of the comments of the members from tunnuniq and kugluktuk are very important to us so that is why we are bringing these four positions out
but today some of the men are just scared and fearful of women even when they are couples some men it is not the case with all the men but some of them are fearful of their wives because they know that the wife will get all the support and services
in the past that is not how it was the men were not denigrated by the women but today it seems to be that way i would think that the majority of the people that commit crimes are usually men and i feel that the men are instigated to commit crimes
i hope that sometime in the future when a couple has charged her spouse i would suggest that we look to the root cause of the problem if the female charges her husband or her boyfriend and right away after he is charged he has to go through the court right away rather than trying to find out what the real cause of the problem is and that guy has to go through the court system
some of the people have to go through the court system some of them are charged for summary convictions if they committed a crime according to the inuit way perhaps they could have had an opportunity to resolve their issues before going to the court and sometimes individuals have to wait a long time to go to court both the offender and the victim
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
sometimes the older people are in the court or there are some elders who go into court to resolve something and they are unable to make a decision that the offender has to follow whether it is a conditional order or something like that
thank you mr speaker
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we are trying to assist the communities to be able to take on the roles that they would like to take according to the inuit culture
we are very grateful to judge brown who works in the communities with the elders that could help and assists them in doing justice in the communities
however we all know that this is just the beginning and we will continue to work on this on trying to improve by using the inuit culture in the court system
we are very grateful for people who have started this in the communities and we are thankful to our staff for being able to implement and use inuit culture because they recognize the inuit culture has a lot more to offer when it comes to people who commit crimes
we will continue to work on that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you
mr anawak already mentioned about the justices of the peace and the numbers of justices of the peace in the communities are growing and they will be taking on some training as well
i was wondering if the plan that you had in place for the jps has been implemented now
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
starting on april 1 there is only one physical courthouse in nunavut
only one location
what we are trying to do in the communities is have the jp and the nunavut court work together and the justice committees work together as well in the communities with the jp right in the community as long as they are willing to take on those responsibilities
right now we have only one court here in nunavut but when the nunavut government began we started doing a review of the legislation and we are trying to revise that
as an example last week there was somebody in court and they were told that there was nothing in place in nunavut because we were following the gnwt way
at this time we are trying to get the justice committees in each community and the jps to work together
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr nutarak do you have any other comments
thank you
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
mr chairman do we have a quorum
anyway i wanted to ask the minister and his staff
you touched on on the land camps and alternative homes
a few years back i was involved in setting up one of those camps in our region
how well do those kinds of camps work
i am just curious because you were talking about that in your opening comments
i am just curious because i know the one in our area didn t work very well because of the distance
i don t know i just want to know how those camps operate did it fail why those things
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister
hon jack anawak
thank you
we would like to do as much as we can for the outpost camp program
i guess part of the problem in the past was that there was probably not adequate preparations to start an outpost camp program
so in the outpost camp program of course some worked better than others
we are in the process of setting one up in arviat as i speak right now where the camp is about 100 miles up the goose river
what we want to do is promote the outpost camp program but in the process make sure that the people who operate those outpost camp programs have the training required have the necessary knowledge of whatever their responsibilities
again i think that if we can get more outpost camp programs or if there are more proposals for outpost camp programs we would look at it because we want to promote that
we just had a gathering of outpost camp operators and alternative homes to give them more training
so i would just respond by saying that in the past maybe part of the problem was inadequate training inadequate funding or inadequate knowledge of what the responsibilities were
however we will provide all that if we are going to initiate an outpost camp program
qujannamiik
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
just a minute please
i would like to ask the members i know that i do have general comments to make so i would like to ask if mr nutarak could be the chairperson for the committee of the whole while i ask my questions
chairperson mr nutarak interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i will be making my general comments because i think it has been four or five years that i have been a justice of the peace and i would like to talk about some of the suggestions or some thoughts that i have had on it
since i have been working as a justice of the peace i have seen some of the problems of a justice of the peace myself
i know that we are starting to resolve some of the problems that occurred for justices of the peace
to me the problem is that the regulations or the policies do not reflect the inuit way of life
that is where the problem kept occurring
as a justice of the peace you cannot bypass these regulations or policies
according to my experience these regulations governing the justice of the peace should reflect the inuit way of life
when you are a justice of the peace and you have to deal with a person who has committed a summary crime it becomes very hard especially when you have to follow the rules that you cannot bypass
as inuit people since i was a child i am sure some of us can remember that if we did something wrong we would be talked to and disciplined that way so that the problem that occurred would not reoccur
so we used to be disciplined orally if we did something wrong
that way the discipline used to work a lot
as a justice of the peace you cannot do that
so that is where i have seen the problem
secondly i understood the fact that when you live in a community everyone knows each other especially when you are a justice of the peace
when you are from the same community you tend to be related to each and every one in the community and i find it pretty hard having to try someone who is your relative
as a justice of the peace i used to think that the jp locally should go to another person in a different community rather than trying a relative in the home community
i know that it would cost money but that is one of the solutions that i have thought of going to a different community to try an individual who has been charged
i know that this has created a personal problem for me when you have to try your own relative in the court
this breaks the family unity when that happens
so i have seen that problem as a justice of the peace
i apologize for coughing and i forgot my glass of water up there
i also would like to stress that the elders take part in the court system and when they help the judge out when the judge is trying an individual these elders who are sitting up there with the judge they don t even receive an honoraria
they are not paid a penny and they have to get away although they have work at home and they are not even paid a penny
i have seen that myself personally these elders really do not know the means how to make money so this has to be considered and this needs to be resolved and if the justices of the peace could be allowed to verbally reprimand the individual
i know that i have encountered this problem and this needs to be resolved
i just wanted to point this out under my general comment
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation

ministers forum on the economy
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i want to take this opportunity to inform this house of an upcoming event that will be of great interest to all members here
many of the members will remember that during the first session in may of last year i delivered a statement on our economy
at that time i made a commitment to a process that would lead to the development of a new economic strategy for nunavut
we called the process the minister s forum on the economy
mr speaker i am pleased to announce today that the minister s forum on the economy will take place may 11 and 12 2000 in iqaluit and in conjunction with the nunavut associations of municipalities annual general meeting
the forum will provide the opportunity for representatives from each of our communities to meet together with me and i hope with other leaders including the members of this house and to discuss economic development in nunavut
we face many questions when considering an economic strategy for nunavut
mr speaker i am aware that many of our communities have already taken steps to address these questions and to plan for their community s future
community plans have been developed in pelly bay and gjoa haven
we are all aware of the excellent work of the community round table in arviat and the community economic development plan created in clyde river
i hope this meeting will be a productive exchange of ideas between communities ideas which can shape the future direction of my department
i hope all members will share my enthusiasm for our chance in may of this year to seek out the participation of community leaders in the development of an economic strategy for the territory of nunavut

nunavut prospectors program
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
last year my department provisionally implemented a prospectors program in nunavut so that our prospectors could continue their important work over the summer months thirty two prospectors in twelve communities participated in the program
in fact the program was such a success that we had to accommodate a greater number of applications than we had originally budgeted for
however no real policy existed for this program for the nunavut government
so over the winter we examined this program in detail
we spoke with prospectors to determine where their needs were the greatest and we began development of a new nunavut prospectors program
i am pleased to announce today the establishment of the nunavut prospectors policy and program which will serve and support the critical work that our prospectors perform in assessing nunavut s potential
mr speaker nunavut has tremendous mineral potential and our independent community based prospectors play a critical role in the discovery and the development of nunavut s mineral potential
the nunavut prospectors program will provide registered prospectors with contributions of up to 5 thousand dollars to assist in the costs associated with prospecting
i am pleased to report to the house that the nunavut prospectors program has been built on the bathurst mandate s principal of simplicity as we have made it easier for prospectors to account for their expenditures and to document their work
the department of sustainable development will assist in building prospecting capacity in nunavut by ensuring nunavut prospectors are supported by department geologists in kugluktuk and arviat
we have also built on the bathurst principal of simplifying access to our programs by establishing a toll free number for anyone seeking information on this program in inuktitut or english
basic prospecting courses will also be delivered by the department in some communities with high potential
mr speaker later today i will table the guide for the nunavut prospectors program

clyde river and pond inlet rangers
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i rise today to talk about the pond inlet rangers who went to clyde river this month
the rangers from our community went to meet the other rangers part way
the visitors were welcomed to the community and were hosted to a feast
on behalf of the people of clyde river i would like to thank them
they are going through several communities and symbolically delivering water from the different communities
paul ujagasujuk is the main guide
many years now the europeans have been travelling across the north with inuit guides so i am very proud to say that paul ujagasujuk will guide the four non inuit people who are travelling to iqaluit carrying the water
they are also going to qikiqtarjuaq and that is one of my communities and i expect they will be received warmly when they arrive

funding for polaris site cleanup
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will be speaking in english
interpretation ends the minister responsible for sustainable development in regards to the polaris mine closure scheduled for october 2001
mr speaker i wish to further question the minister about the effects the closure will have on the nearby community
my question is can the minister give clear indication of the amount of funding allocated for the site clean up and how it will be administered
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr kilabuk

question 504   13
income support productive choices
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to direct my question to the minister for education who is also the minister responsible for income support
his minister s statement was very interesting in regards to income support s productive choice program
when he talks about recipients are you talking about the elderly young people or mature adults
my question is that do you expect all the people receiving income support to go back to school
i think this should be more detailed information because these recipients are hunters and some of them are physically disabled
so could you clarify this for me
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
minister for education mr arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
we are not concerned what the people s age is whether they are young or old
but we do have a goal and we do have a policy that this income support recipient should be willing to look for a job and should be willing to take on that training so they can stand up on their own two feet
or they should be willing to help the community by volunteering
we are not overly concerned about their ages but the goal we used has not changed yet
i am able to inform you if the member can understand that i am very pleased to say that we are working towards these initiatives
the results have shown that we help them when they look for a job for example thirty people who have been able to find employment in iqaluit this month
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr arvaluk
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

prospectors program funding process
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of sustainable development in nunavut
when he made a statement regarding the nunavut prospectors program and he said that some funds have been made available for that purpose and he said if they have any questions they could call
who would i call if i wanted further information
thank you mr speaker

mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation

i apologise the phone number is not listed but anybody is welcome to call my office if they wanted further information in regards o the nunavut prospectors program in iqaluit

oral questions mr barnabas
question 506   13
firearms acquisition certificate course
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i will speak in english
interpretation ends to the minister of justice
mr speaker it is now very hard for hunters to acquire firearms acquisition certificates especially if they do not understand english
there will be a course held in igloolik in either june or july on how to apply for a firearms acquisition certificate
only if there are enough people and if they pay twenty five dollar fee
it was understood there would be no an abrogation clause for aboriginal hunters in certain aspects of the application of the gun control laws
this seems to be overlooked and is very hard for individuals who have little income and for those who do not understand english
could the minister of justice inform members of this house on what his department is doing to help gun users especially hunters who have no other means of making a living
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am sorry i did not attend that one meeting i think it was last week we had a briefing session for the members of the legislative assembly
this is not our responsibility
it is the responsibility of the federal government
the members wanted a briefing on the firearms acquisition certificates
mr lamab was in attendance at the meeting and he informed us that he has retained two employees to deal with facs
one is josh teemootee the other person will start out in the near future and she is able to speak in inuktitut and english
at the briefing for the members he informed us that people already had some training in clyde river cape dorset and other communities will be shortly receiving the course
the federal employees are in the process of getting this work together and i am sorry but i do not have the telephone numbers to give to the members
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker because i used to do translations i know that with certain legislation there is a lengthy interpretation of the legislation when you put it into inuktitut
for someone who does not write in english we will have to get them the information about the people that are working for the federal government on gun control
such items as crisis lines are not always used by the people different people that want different information
i just wondered if the minister is aware of whether the people will be able to phone this telephone number as they are doing their application form
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
minister for justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
mr speaker perhaps if the member attended the presentation he would have been able to get the information because the people that gave us the presentation were saying that they will be able to help people acquire their fac
if a person is a hunter the application form is shorter than the regular application form and the people are going to assist the public they will be able to inform them as to how they to fill out the application form
although they would have to ask questions they will be able to assist the public in filling out their application form
whoever wants to get information not just for the purposes of informing the public but also to help the public in filling out their application forms for firearms certificates
as well the public will be informed about the job they have done in clyde river and cape dorset
it was very informative when this person gave us the presentation
i know that there is a 1 800 number and i do not have it with me at the moment but i know these people will be able to give you information
they will probably use the media and the local radio station
i know they will also have other materials to inform the public as to their whereabouts and their 1 800 number and they will be able to speak in english and inuktitut they should be able to assist the public if the public needs assistance
they will be also working on informing the communities in the summer
we expect we will have some people working on this licensing in the communities

how long will it take for an adequate clean up to be carried out and what impact will that have on the development of the proposed park

policing in nunavut
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to inform the legislative assembly about some positive developments with respect to policing
first i am pleased to say that two more inuit recruits recently graduated from the rcmp training program in regina
they are ian monteith and john tagak
ian monteith has been posted to igloolik and john tagak to iqaluit
these graduates follow the six inuit recruits who graduated last october and are now on active duty in various communities
we should all proud that our young people are choosing to take the rigorous rcmp training so that they can make real contributions to their communities as rcmp officers
i wish to extend my personal congratulations to ian monteith and john tagak
second mr speaker i want to inform the members of the commanding officer s inuit advisory committee
chief superintendent bothe of v division has recently established the inuit advisory committee to provide him and his detachment with advice on inuit culture and community matters
the committee will also serve as a link between the rcmp and the communities by explaining the procedures of the rcmp to the communities
the committee has six members two from each region
the members will rotate every two years
chief superintendent bothe will select the committee members on recommendation from community leaders and detachment commanders
the present members of the inuit advisory committee are leah metuk from pangnirtung alesuk idlout from resolute bay jeannie iqaluq from sanikiluaq guy kakkianuin from pelly bay fiona corey from cambridge bay and mariano aupilardjuk from rankin inlet
interpretation ends i believe the rcmp inuit advisory committee is another way that relations between the rcmp and inuit communities will be strengthened
i welcome this initiative by chief superintendent bothe
finally mr speaker i would like to report on the community constable program
members will know that the community constable program was started in 1986 to enhance the role of by law enforcement officers
funding for community constables by law enforcement is normally the responsibility of the community in partnership with the department of community government  transportation and the department of justice
the rcmp provides a four week training course at a training academy in regina
once the training is completed community constables may receive an appointment as a supernumerary special constable under the rcmp act
this allows the community constables to assist the rcmp while on duty and under the supervision of the rcmp member
interpretation mr speaker there are presently 25 community constables in nunavut
the rcmp have indicated that they are pleased with the service being provided by the community constables
whale cove chesterfield inlet and repulse bay do not have rcmp detachments
the rcmp in partnership with the nunavut department of justice agreed to fund community constables in each of these communities for a two year period under the inuit policing program
repulse bay and chesterfield inlet presently have two community constables each while whale cove has one community constable
the community constable program is continuing to grow and to work well in our communities
i am pleased to say that in all the examples i have given you today we can see positive steps in the services being provided to nunavut by the rcmp

task force on housing   final report
hon manitok thompson interpretation
good morning mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to inform the house that i will be tabling the task force on housing s final report under tabling of documents
mr speaker the final report is a very comprehensive report that contains a total of 15 recommendations
a cursory review of the recommendations reflects the hard work and dedication of the task force members
mr speaker the first recommendation supporting a stand alone housing corporation was achieved on april 1 2000
i am very happy that we were able to achieve one of the basic recommendations at the outset
mr speaker we must be realistic and recognize that the remaining recommendations will take time to properly analyse before implementation
interpretation ends let me state for the record that this report will be carefully reviewed and will not gather dust on a shelf somewhere
we are very serious in wanting to make fundamental changes where possible that will benefit nunavummiut
interpretation mr speaker the fifth recommendation to complete a housing needs assessment is also a priority
the northwest territories housing corporation completed the last needs assessment in 1996
it is essential that we have current information to adequately address the housing requirements within nunavut
mr speaker i will be asking the nunavut housing corporation to complete this assessment on a priority basis
interpretation ends mr speaker it is important to recognize that some key recommendations within this final report such as changes to the current rent scale and the high rates by public housing for municipal services cannot be implemented by nunavut housing corporation in isolation
it will be necessary to ask for co operation and agreement from other government departments in order to achieve these recommendations
mr speaker we support the bathurst mandate objective to open and maintain a public dialogue on housing issues while developing and implementing immediate and long term plans to respond to housing shortfalls mr speaker you have my commitment that the community housing experts in the local housing organizations and the empowered hamlets will be included in the analysis of these recommendations
mr speaker the task force on housing s final report has clearly outlined the many challenges that we face
interpretation this will not be a simple task that can be completed overnight
this will take time and will need to be reviewed and revised as we proceed
we must make a commitment to work together to meet the housing needs of nunavummiut
finally mr speaker i would like to thank once again
enoki irqittuq hunter tootoo david iqaqrialu uriash puqiqnak and also darrin nichol david akoak and sandra turner for their hard work as members of the housing task force

bobby suwarak
hon jack anawak
mr speaker i am pleased to inform the legislative assembly about the accomplishments of bobby suwarak an inmate of the baffin correctional centre
mr suwarak has been at the baffin correctional centre since september of 1999
he is unique because he is deaf and is limited in his use of sign language
while he does not use the american sign language which is common among the deaf he and his friends and family from baker lake have worked out a special sign language for his use
interpretation mr suwarak needed his interpreter from baker lake mr david kautaq if he was going to be able to participate in treatment programs at bcc
i am pleased to say that the staff at bcc made arrangements with northern stores who employ mr kautaq to allow him to move from baker lake to iqaluit on a temporary transfer as an interpreter
mr suwarak then worked with the psychologist at bcc and mr kautaq and was able to engage in treatment programs
mr suwarak then indicated that he wished to attend school
he has limited formal education because of his disability
with the help of the teacher at the baffin correctional centre and his interpreter he enrolled in arctic college for upgrading
interpretation ends i am pleased to report that last thursday mr suwarak received the literary council award for student of the year at a ceremony at arctic college
this was a well deserved award that paid tribute to mr suwarak s hard work and dedication
interpretation i would also like to point out that this kind of success story is a good example of what could be accomplished when the staff at the baffin correctional centre get co operation from private interests such as northern store and community members like mr david kautaq
i also want to congratulate arctic college for their willingness to take bobby suwarak as a student and mr dan page mr suwarak s teacher for his dedicated work
with this kind of co operation between the government and community institutions and individuals we are going to achieve more successes like this

respect for all dialects
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to make a few comments on an issue that is very important to me our inuktitut language
inuit have many different dialects
when we start talking about other people s dialects negatively it contributes to the loss of the inuit culture and language
when we are making fun of other people s dialects or the way they pronounce certain words the only language that they revert to is the english language
the inuit language is unique and i would suggest that we do not mock other people s dialects because it is unique to their region
it is very important for the future and for generations if we are going to preserve and protect our culture and language
we are starting to lose our inuktitut language because people especially young people are shy to speak their language because somebody else might make fun of them
i believe that we should respect other people s dialects because there are various dialects out there
i am trying to suggest to everyone that they use their own unique dialect if we are going to preserve and protect our own language

access road for grise fiord hunters
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
first i would like to add my condolences to our commissioner for his family s tragic loss over the long weekend
mr speaker it has been almost three years ago that i went hunting in grise fiord while visiting my constituency
the sea ice has just left in grise fiord although the other communities had been boating for quite a while
mr speaker we were stuck at a point for two days at a point just little distance past grise fiord
i realized mr speaker that the hunters of grise fiord do not have the same advantages as hunters of other communities
when we went out there we had already loaded our catch but we were not able to go to the community itself because of the ice conditions
mr speaker the access road in arctic bay is very beneficial to our community because the people of arctic bay can use that access road to go hunting during these types of conditions
the people of grise fiord do not have that same benefit and they get stuck when the ice comes back in or when the ice is eroding where you can t go by snowmobile or out by boat
mr speaker i would like to get unanimous consent from the members to continue my statement
speaker interpretation
the member is asking for unanimous consent to conclude his statement
any nays
proceed

thank you mr speaker
i rise today to talk about some good and some not so good news
many of our young people do not speak inuinnaqtun anymore and our elders are having a hard time communicating with them
sometimes they get shy because the way they speak the language
when the elders see this they wonder how can we teach them in innuinaqtut so they can get their own language back
the elders  culture and the young people lives are different today
it is not the same as long ago
i would urge the young people and the elders to get together so they can see how they can work together as they did a long time ago
we should do the same today

youth abroad programs

miali coley a student from iqaluit has written to ask me for support for her canada world youth proposal to travel to ontario and to ecuador to live in each area for 3 months while she works on a volunteer project related to social services
recently other members and i met with students who are participating in the nunavut youth abroad program in rankin inlet

mr speaker not only are our young people like this ambassadors for our territory but they will return with the knowledge and experiences to share with other members of the community
opportunities such as these give nunavut youth positive experiences and wish to grow and develop
this knowledge and experience will build their abilities to become the leaders of the future
in this way opportunities such as this can benefit all of nunavut as well as to the individuals who participate in them
mr speaker i will be making an investment in our future by donating one hundred dollars towards each student s goal
i encourage other members of the assembly to encourage and support youth from their communities and from across nunavut to take part in programs such as these that will provide them with invaluable experiences
the future leaders of nunavut will need learning knowledge and experience to carry on the tasks of running this territory to the best of their abilities
it is up to the leaders of today to make every effort to ensure that opportunities are available to support the leaders of tomorrow

easter tragedies
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
prior to 1999 when we started establishing the nunavut government the people told us what they wanted during the pre consultations tours to the communities
the inuit wanted to have a transparent and open government and we are still very sensitive to that
they wanted the government to have a heart
there were two tragic incidents that happened during the easter break
our commissioner peter irniq s daughter who was very young tragically died down south
we send our condolences
it is very evident that the people of nunavut feel the same sorrow and they have expressed sympathy for the family
we are with them through our prayers and our sympathies
right after that tragedy there was also another tragic death in cambridge bay
one of the instructors at the arctic college mrs margaret lyall passed away
she was with her husband johnny lyall who survived
we have sent our condolences to the family
i want the public to know we are sensitive
i do not want people to think that because we are a new government that we do not have a heart
we are human beings and we still have the same feelings as anyone
i just wanted to point that out
i would like to send our condolences and sympathy peter irniq s family and also to the family of johnny lyall
we will keep them in mind through our minds and prayer

i am very pleased to rise today to make a few comments
when we were just hunters it was totally different from the way we live today
when we were living out on the land although we enjoyed surviving off the land
i know myself because i have experienced it
the way we live today is totally different from the past
even though we went to our respective communities on the long weekend
because my life has not changed from the past and i am very pleased to say that
i wanted make a brief comment on that
when i got home i was exhausted
during the weekend just like the time when i use to go out hunting out on the land i would come home totally exhausted
that is how exactly how i felt when i went home
i told my wife i am exhausted the same way as i use to go when i went out hunting
although my life has changed in a way it is still the same

question 508   13
payment for grave workers
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i have asked this question numerous times when we became members of the legislative assembly
it is in regards to an event that happened in 1968 this event happened in my community
there were some people that moved or transferred some graves sites to another location
i asked the minister mr anawak as to what is happening to the payment of those workers
these questions were asked by previous member of the legislature of the nwt mark evaluardjuk
i think it was in 1998 that he was asking these questions to the federal government through the gnwt
mr speaker i am trying to ask the question again
the response was that the person that was in charge could not be contacted or was lost somehow
so i am wondering what is happening with this issue
speaker
minister responsible for justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
some correspondence stated that after six years the papers are destroyed in accordance with the rules of the federal government
but i am sure the individuals that requested the transfer of the gravesites would like to be compensated
i am sure there have been other incidences that happened that the inuit would like pursued
although this is not the responsibility of the nunavut government perhaps we could relay this message to the federal government and state that the federal government s response was not adequate for us
i will be pursuing this and to try to contact the person that dealt with this in the first place and i will speak with the member and we will deal with this as soon as we can
like i mentioned that the people feel for this project that was started earlier on
we as well have to have a feeling for the requests of that community and i will speak with the member and resolve this

we really enjoy hearing about this type of news especially in regards to the young people entering the police force
i just want to ask the minister if the guidelines for northern policing are changing
speaker interpretation
minister responsible for justice
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to northern policing the guidelines have to be followed at the same time i would like to assure the member and the members of the legislative assembly and the people of nunavut that the v division in nunavut i met with chris bothe of the v division in iqaluit and he informed me that because he lives in an inuit community and lives in nunavut he will make sure that he will not break the law or the guidelines but he will be promoting the inuit culture by providing northern police constables
i believe in chris bothe s wishes about what he wants to do in regards to northern policing in the north and i mentioned earlier that they have a committee in place who are the people named earlier
this advisory committee will be working with the rcmp as to how they can best get inuit constables and to respect the culture of the inuit people while doing their job and they will try to use inuit qaujimajatuqangit while doing their work as an advisory committee

there are many people who own their own homes and the elders also own their own homes
the elders only receive a pension and they have to pay for fuel utilities water and other things

federal government funding for housing
mr iqaqrialu interpretation

is the federal government providing funding to the nunavut government for housing
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
minister responsible for the housing corporation
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i apologise i was rushing around
the cmhc provides money to the nunavut government through an agreement that was signed between the nunavut housing corporation and on top of that the cmhc provides funding to the nunavut government
i believe it is around 16 million dollars
that is shown in our main estimates because of course it comes from a third party
we receive those funds from the cmhc
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker to supplement my question are we going to be reducing the amount of services provided to the elders
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
madame minister
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the money that used to come to the housing corporation for renovations maintenance and so on for our rental units is already depleted as i said before
in 1993 that was the last time we got funding to build housing
the money has no longer been provided for capital projects since 1993
the money for operations and maintenance again will gradually be depleted in the future
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since the money will gradually be reduced for the people living in social housing that receive benefits for example getting their utilities paid for are these benefits still going to be paid out by the government
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the housing corporation ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the money comes from the department of social services and i believe it is thirty two dollars per month per tenant to pay for utilities and so on which is paid to the housing corporation the monies that are paid for utilities are very large and like i said earlier we will be setting up a 5 year plan and i will be tabling that plan in the fall
this is something that is of major concern when we are talking about the om dollars that will gradually be discontinued
the om dollars are used to pay for utilities and not for maintenance and neither are they for capital
as there is going to be a gradual decrease it is a major concern to all governments
there are also the fifteen recommendations that were made by the housing task force
we are going to be considering those and i will be working with the various government departments to talk about the provision of water and other utilities and see how they can help us with the payment for these houses
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in regards to the payment of the operations for housing i also believe we should include the employees
they end up paying a large portion of their salaries for their rent
how are they going to be included when you are considering all of housing
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister responsible for the housing corporation
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
there are fifteen recommendations included in the housing task force report
there are fifteen recommendations and on the seventh one it states that we should look into the rent scale
this is one of the major concerns of the people of nunavut and like mr iqaqrialu stated we know exactly where this concern is coming from because there are a lot of employees or people in the work force who can t meet the rent scale
since this is one of the recommendations we will be reviewing it but then again we cannot do this on our own
we have to work with the cmhc and since we operate under the policies of the cmhc we have to come to an agreement with the cmhc to deal with the rent agreement
coming in june we are going to start working on the recommendations that were made by the task force

question 513   13
changes to housing rent scale
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for the housing corporation
she stated that there is going to be a gradual decrease in the amount of money they are going to receive from the cmhc for their om
with housing still very expensive up here and with the gradual decrease in money from the federal government my question is will there still be an increase in the rent scale with the gradual reduction from monies coming from the federal government
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
minister responsible for the housing corporation ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the money we receive from the cmhc there will be a gradual decrease not right away
sometime in the future there will be a gradual decrease and we probably will not feel the effects right now with this present government
it is very gradual but there is going to be a gradual decrease right until there is no more money coming in from the cmhc
with that we are very concerned and are looking at options on how we can deal with it as a housing corporation and the fifteen recommendations that were tabled are going to be tabled by the task force
the task force on housing has been working extremely well and looking at options and recommendations
we are going to start taking this gradual decrease into consideration and look at ways and means of how we can work with the federal government
the minister of income support will be considering this
the minister of education is going to be doing a tour and i am sure there are going to be comments made on the issue of housing
we will have to work with the various government departments on the housing issue and to make a plan on what we are going to be doing because of the amount of dollars we receive
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
since those are already going to be taken into consideration are you going to be working with the federal government to determine how you can better provide assistance
are you saying that you are going to be working with the federal government to look at other options
thank you mr speaker
speaker
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes this has been an ongoing process and the federal government has already told us what their plans are
the housing corporation has known for quite a while since way back in 1993 when the capital dollars for building new housing was cut off
from then on we had an understanding that the om dollars in the future were going to be decreased until there was nothing coming in
with that understanding we have been working with the present government and the government of the gnwt to look at options and also to provide access housing because we believe that the inuit should not be only renting units
in the nunavut area there are many people renting and we are working on this issue

mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
it is good to be back i had a weather delay and it is good to see the speaker of the week
i hope this is not a trend that is going to continue
i hope everybody had a happy easter
my question today is to the minister responsible for housing
mr speaker where there is a strong private sector and strong housing market from the private sector and with the recent announcement of 100 construction units being built in nunavut would the minister consider in centres like iqaluit rankin inlet and cambridge bay to cancel building those units and go to the private sector for those housing units
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
i am sure the member for baker lake was rushing here to ask me the question and i am glad he walked in before the question period is gone
yes i have been doing that as you know we do have some money allocated for the leasing of housing in nunavut
i have put forward a request for people or individuals that might be able to lease houses to us
that is something that we are doing right now
this is an issue we were dealing with as soon as my budget was approved
speaker
supplementary mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
my supplementary question to that is that is a good answer and the minister recognizes that there is a strong private sector out there and a surplus of private homes to rent
would she also consider the communities like clyde river where there is a desperate housing shortage if she is going to reallocate housing units from iqaluit and rankin inlet and cambridge bay
would she look at the neediest communities like clyde river and other communities that do not have a large housing market
for example hall beach and pond inlet that she would look at relocating those units to those communities that need them most
speaker
thank you mr mclean
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
we would consider that if there are housing units to lease from the private sector
we know that everybody has a waiting list of people for each community that has been allocated housing and that is something that we would consider but we have to find affordable housing for leasing
we have to be within reason so right now what we are doing is asking the private sector for units available for leasing
i do know that clyde river especially and kugluktuk and arviat have the highest waiting lists according to the survey that was done
if it is at all possible to find some units to lease from those communities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
supplementary mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
on that note could the minister agree that when she is doing this that we are not held to ransom on exorbitant leases and high costs
because we know there is a lot of high cost housing and i wouldn t like to see this government get into leases that they can t afford
can the minister assure me that she will look at this and she will look at the price factor and make her decision based on price and not just because there are some empty units in a community because it is very important that she look at the cost factor and not get caught in that whole trap again
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
yes i will look into that and we are only going to be leasing units that are affordable to this government

oral questions mr tootoo
question 515   13
relocating new public housing units
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question is for the minister responsible for housing
she just indicated to the member from baker lake that she is looking at some of the construction of public housing units that she talked about from the regional centres to the communities that need them
mr speaker i would like to ask her if she plans on consulting with the mlas and the lhos from those communities prior to making any of those decisions on whether that is going to happen or not
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of housing
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker yes i would do that
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i believe that it was during committee of the whole that i asked the minister in regards to these units and the money that she had referred to in her budget for the leasing of units
she had indicated then that it was on a five year they were looking at five year leases or something short term fix until the plan was to eventually move people from those units to government owned units over time
as we know leases are an ongoing thing and a public housing unit once it is built is an asset to the government
so i would just like again to ask the minister as a result of her comments here today have those plans changed
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
nothing has changed except that we are looking at options to address the housing shortage in nunavut
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
third and final supplementary sorry
one more mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
it may be my last one
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i would just like to ask the minister from what i just heard this morning in the minister s response to the member from baker lake is that the minister is planning on some changes already to what she had already indicated earlier in the session and what the recommendations were to my understanding that the task force had made and she had accepted
it sounds like to me that there have already been some suggestions or some move to change that
i would like to ask her if she would one meet with the members and inform them prior to any more changes or any further changes or any finalisation of changes before she does
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
there are very good ideas from other members that we can address and that s all i indicated is that the member here just asked me earlier if we can lease from other communities and put some units somewhere else where the need is
if we can lease six units for instance in a bigger community right away instead of building those units we can do that because recommendations are just that they are recommendations
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
final supplementary mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in light of the minister s comments then would she be willing to provide this house with a costbenefit analysis as to looking at the feasibility of leasing units over a long term as opposed to building the units and having them as an asset for the government
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr tootoo
minister of housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson
thank you mr speaker
the bottom line is we have empty units out there and we have people on the waiting list that can get into those units
so we have to find an affordable way of using those units
do we keep those units out there empty and not do anything about it or do we do something about it if we can afford it

question 517   13
laws on vehicle insurance in nunavut
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my question is directed to the minister of justice or transportation
mr speaker i will ask the question in english to the minister
interpretation ends people in nunavut are just beginning to learn about canadian laws but too many still don t know how to use them for their benefit
lawyers too are not readily available and many don t know how to seek their expertise
other canadians in the south use the courts when they need to
whenever one is involved in a vehicle accident we in nunavut are still not doing this as many are still not aware of their rights
there have been many various vehicle accidents and deaths but many people do not seek the court s help to collect on vehicle or operator insurance
in nunavut vehicles and drivers are required to have insurance if they will be driving
my question is do nunavut government laws require loss of life insurance
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister of justice mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
all the people have to have insurance for their vehicles but i am not really sure about the question that he is asking
i will get back to the member
thank you

mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
my question again is to the minister of housing

thank you mr speaker

oral questions
mr iqaqrialu
question 519   13
ownership of vacant houses
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am sorry but i had a supplementary question to the housing minister
the houses that are approximately 100 but are vacant who do they belong to
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
the houses in question belong to the public or people that left the community to pursue employment in another community
those houses are vacant at the present time nunavut wide
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the communities that have vacant houses perhaps the minister could advise me through correspondence which communities those empty units are in
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr iqaqrialu
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
amagoalik and associates was asked whether they could look into or do a survey in regards to renting those empty units
they found the communities and using just one day to phone the communities i am not exactly sure where they are located at this time
perhaps i can give the member through correspondence an incomplete list of the vacant houses and also to inform him about leasing procedures because this leasing procedure was not dealt with through the housing task force
the only thing that the housing task force concentrated on was building 100 houses and i have asked amagoalik and associates consultants to look into the vacant houses in the communities
perhaps some of the units are already rented out but i am not sure exactly what communities they are located in
they did the survey in one day so i will be able to give mr iqaqrialu a draft
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation

mr nutarak
question 520   13
amending nunavut housing corporation policies
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is also a question to the minister of housing
the housing corporation used to belong to the gnwt but now we will be having a stand alone housing corporation
i have a question for the minister of housing
the guidelines or the policies that the northwest territories housing corporation had are they now the guidelines or the policies of nunavut
i just wondered whether those would be followed by the nunavut housing corporation
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
in the recommendations out of the fifteen that the housing task force requested in recommendation number 2 it states that the guidelines and the policies of the housing corporation they requested them to be amended
we will be dealing with them this fall as requested by the housing task force
we have the policies and the guidelines but we will be amending them
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
supplementary mr nutarak
mr nutarak interpretation
also a question to the minister of housing
the task force on housing recommended under recommendation number two to change and amend the policies and the guidelines
i wonder how long the minister will take to amend those and change the guidelines
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr nutarak
ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
like i mentioned earlier on under recommendation number 7 it states that the casual and full time employees we will be reviewing those recommendations and those guidelines
canada mortgage and housing corporation will have to be involved if we are going to change the guidelines because they are in an agreement with us and providing funding to the nunavut housing corporation
if we are going to change the policies and the guidelines we will have to work with cmhc in doing this and we will start on this housing task force recommendation 7 to change the policy and guidelines this coming summer
i am not sure exactly how long it will take us but we will attend to it as soon as we can
speaker interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr barnabas
question 521   13
funding for relocating power plants
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker my question will be directed to the minister of the nunavut power corporation
mr speaker i believe that we will be using 45 million dollars for the relocation of ntpc to clyde river to relocate the plant
if the other communities have similar problems would we use that same amount of money to relocate the power plant to another location
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the power corporation and i just want to make sure that i am clear on the question asked by the member is not relocating in clyde river mr speaker
in actuality what is happening is that we are building a new plant in clyde river
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
supplementary mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i understand exactly why you have to build a new plant
i would like clarification on the other communities
how many communities want to relocate their power plant to another location
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the cost of the new plant in clyde river is about 45 million to 5 million dollars
so it isn t actually locating the plant relocating the plant
there has been some concern mr speaker where the power plant is located in the middle of the community
i would not be able to say at this time mr speaker how many communities actually have come forward in a formalised way with a proposal to have their plant moved
in actuality mr speaker in some cases some of the communities would like to keep the plant where it is because we are using it as a benefit to the community
for example in taloyoak the plant is in the middle of the community and the last time i was there about a month and a half ago the plant was being used for the reheat of the water
so that is working well there
in some other communities there has been some concern about noise and some of the smoke from the plant itself
however i would not be able at this time to give the member the actual number of how many communities have come forward with a formalised concern about moving their plant
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
supplementary mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to thank the minister for his appropriate response
mr speaker my supplementary question is in regards to the communities that would like to relocate their plant because they could always recycle the waste heat for other facilities
for those communities that would like to relocate their plants is there money set aside so that there could be relocation of their plants so that there could be an improvement in the pollution coming out of the plant
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker actually there are two kinds of questions there
one is on the emission standards of the power plant
as the member know the power corporation as any other organization or corporation has to follow the emission standards set out by the canadian government which regulates federal emission standards for smoke and so on
mr speaker on the second question
thank you mr speaker as you can see that mr ng would like to get back home
mr speaker on the second part of the member s question no there are actually no dollars allocated within the budget or the capital budget of the new nunavut power corporation for the actual relocation of a plant in the 20 year capital plan for the northwest territories power corporation and the nunavut power corporation
we have different items that have to be replaced but there are no specific monies allocated for the relocation of a plant
if a particular community made a formal request to me as the minister responsible for the power corporation if there was a health concern if there was a safety concern and so on that a plant had to be removed then i would look at it in that respect
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr picco
final supplementary mr barnabas
mr barnabas
thank you mr speaker
i know the nunavut power corporation has a plan in case of an accident like an oil spill that is major
however i have noticed that in some communities in case their plant burned down there are no emergency backups for other generators to keep the community functioning
are there any plans to put emergency backups in the communities that don t have emergency backup generators
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr barnabas
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member brings up an interesting point
sorry mr speaker it is very difficult sitting here with some of my colleagues
mr speaker the member brings up a very interesting point
that point being the location of emergency power at a time of an incident where the power would be unavailable for example with the power plant burning down
in iqaluit for example we have located because the community of iqaluit is a bit older two power plants one located on the federal road and one located as the member knows on the top of the hill
in each of our communities mr speaker under emergency preparation which i believe is under the honourable mr anawak s office we have in conjunction with the department of education we have allowed for emergency shelters
so for example mr speaker if the power went off for two or three days we know that the nursing station for example has a standby generator for their operations we know that the schools for example mr speaker have a standby generator that would be able to house individuals and so on
the costs mr speaker of putting extra generators and locating them at a separate point in a community based on a plant catching fire or some other catastrophe occurring right now is not fiscally available to us as a government or indeed to the nunavut power corporation
so i hope that helps answer the member s question
i guess i should also add mr speaker on that point
when you are looking at the power plant itself the power plant does not have a backup generator adjacent to it in most cases or located near it
therefore and thus mr speaker we would have to spend more money to relocate and allocate other resources and other generators
in our case mr speaker in the case of diesel generators storage facilities somewhere else in the communities so that we would be able to provide that backup emergency plan
mr speaker there is no budget for that
if again if the member would like to bring forward a proposal that is something mr speaker that we would be able to look at in a very serious manner
i hope that helps answer the member s question
thank you mr speaker

mr irqittuq
question 522   13
required distance from power plants
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for the power corporation
quite a few plants are located right in the middle of the communities
is there a policy on how much distance there should be between the plant and adjacent buildings
what is the closest that you can be to a power plant
thank you mr speaker
speaker interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister responsible for the power corporation mr picco
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker in most of our communities when the power plants were built and they were originally built by the northern canada power commission ncpc our communities were much smaller
they were located in a central location which would allow for a quicker and most effective way of providing transmission lines and so on to the house
over the years mr speaker in many of our communities our communities have expanded and i know the member s town very well because i lived there
the power plant is located in the middle of the community and the community has expanded along the beach in hall beach as an example away from the plant
after saying that mr speaker the power plant is still in the middle of the community
i don t know mr speaker what the limitations are or what the regulations are on the construction side of what the adjacency of buildings and so on would be
i would suspect mr speaker that they would have to follow the building code have to follow the fire code and so on
if that is something that the member needs we would be able to get that information for the member and provide it to him and other interested members in the house

extending the review period for bill 11
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i move seconded by the honourable member for amittuq that rule 681 be waived and that the period for the standing committee on government operations and services to report back to the house on bill 11 an act to establish nunavut day as a holiday be extended to the fall sitting of the legislative assembly
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
the motion is in order
to the motion
mr akesuk
mr akesuk
thank you mr speaker
i would like to speak to this motion
as members are aware bill 11 was introduced during the rankin inlet sitting of the legislative assembly
after its introduction the standing committee decided to place ads in the northern media requesting input and feedback from nunavut residents on this initiative
interpretation members of the standing committee have also been undertaking consultations within their own communities
to date mr speaker i can advise the house that the feedback from our constituents has been mixed
while some agree with the initiative of making july 9 a holiday others are upset that they will be losing a long established august long weekend
members have also been told by some of their constituents that they would prefer to see april 1 be officially recognized in some way
interpretation ends during its meeting last week with the sponsoring minister to review the bill the standing committee was advised that there would be significant cost implications to the government hamlets and the private sector if the government were to add a new public holiday to the calendar rather than just replacing the first monday in august with july 9 as the bill currently sets out to do
the standing committee is also aware of the fact that negotiations with the neu are still in progress
interpretation mr speaker the nunavut association of municipalities will be holding its annual general meeting in early may
the standing committee has directed me as the chair of the committee to meet with nunavut s mayors to formally seek their views and input on this initiative
i am hopeful that a consensus will emerge from this meeting
interpretation ends i would also thank the sponsoring minister for his commitment to providing the information that his department used to calculate the different cost implications associated with this initiative and for any information on how hamlets and their employees would be affected
this will be useful to present to the mayors
mr speaker it is important that issues like this issues that affect the daily lives of all nunavut residents be fully discussed and debated and that the widest possible consultations be held before final decisions are made
and mr speaker given that it is almost may and given that many families will have already made their summer plans i believe that it is appropriate that any changes that occur to the calendar take effect with ample time for individuals and families to plan accordingly
mr speaker it is possible that no consensus will be achieved on this initiative
however these further consultations in the coming weeks will ensure that as many voices as possible are heard and that a wide understanding is achieved of the options available and their implications
your standing committee looks forward to reporting the bill back when we reconvene in the fall
at that time i believe that this house will be in a better position to make its final determination on how to proceed

thank you mr anawak we are on general comments before we get to the main estimates we have mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr minister and staff just a short comment in regards to the smaller communities that want to take in some inmates out on the land
in igloolik there has been a request to the department of justice to take in some inmates to the camps
but they could not do it because they did not have any equipment to take people out on the land
they did not have any transportation equipment and they could not be provided with equipment
to take in inmates that are not going to be incarcerated long and young people could also be taking out to the land and the camps for rehabilitation especially those that have substance abuse problems
they should be given the opportunity to provide them with people that they can take out on the land
under the main estimates or under capital estimates there does not seem to be any funding to help those communities to take out people to the outpost camps from the bcc
speaker interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
for those communities that want to take those inmates out on the land we are in support of this program and we have started to take requests to take prisoners out on the land
we expect that many people will be requesting to take out inmates out on the land
we cannot take them all
i know there are many people who are incarcerated who want to go out to the outpost camps
this is a very good program for other youth that are having problems in the community but we have to talk with the community involved
perhaps we will not be able to provide all funding but we can give the people a little bit of money to subsidise for their gas and their supplies
we are in a process of trying to do this at this time we have to be able to provide as many communities as possible in providing assistance to the inmates or to the youth who have committed crimes in order to rehabilitate them at outpost camps
we are in support of this program
we expect that there would be a lot more people requesting the people who are out in the outpost camps who have committed crime
we are not going to approve everybody who requests to do this program
however we can review the communities that want to take people out on the land but at this time if they could have their equipment already in place we would probably approve them faster than the ones that don t have the equipment
we would like to look into what types of equipment they would have in their community
some communities have equipment and some communities do not have as much equipment as the others do
but we can speak with them but we cannot say that no we refuse to let you go into the program with us
what we can say is that we have to look into what they have and the equipment they have in their communities before we approve what they have to do
we are open to the public but we have to see what type of equipment the community has or the people have that would like to take those inmates out on the land for rehabilitation and if the individual wants to be enrolled in the program then we might be able to help them with food and gas
if they already have these boats and transportation equipment in place already
we are not going to be shutting the doors for anybody
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuqinterpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to ask a brief question
we have to take care of people who are incarcerated although i don t want to talk about people committing crimes but these people need help and they have to be sent to the outpost camps and the correctional centre
the people who are responsible for these inmates like how many people do you need to take care of that many inmates
is there a guard inmate ratio
so that is my question
are they paid by the number of inmates or are they paid annual salary
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kattuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes they vary from community to community
if we have one guard who can work with inmates we would have to work with the guard and see how many inmates he would be willing to take on
if that is going to be the case then we would be definitely paying the guard when he has three inmates to take care of so we would be paying the guard 95 dollars per person a day
not for a year
sometimes it might be the case that the guard will be taking care of that inmate for three or four months at a time we will pay the guard for four months if that inmate is incarcerated for four months and we pay them by per inmate
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to comment and it might be a question too
i m not sure how closely you are working with sustainable development as to what mr irqittuq was just talking about
i also see this a business opportunity for some of the inuit in our communities for employing our elders as counsellors
i m just wondering if you have the criteria to say maybe this is the business opportunity for the individuals in each community
i think in the long run that they might see this as a good way as creating a business in one of the communities in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
i guess the thing to do is that we don t necessarily see this as a business opportunity but at the same time as much as we want to support people who have the willingness to do this kind of thing
if we had somebody on the contract to do this what we would also want to make sure if there is other opportunities for this person to do other things outside of looking after people in the outpost camp
we would not want that person cut off from other business opportunities such as through sustainable development
we might not want that person deprived of other applications for assistance say to start a business on other stuff
we want to make sure that if we put somebody in a home like that we would want that person to feel like they are at home with the home care healing program
so we would want this to be more of a home environment type rather than a business opportunity
but at the same time we want to make sure that this is an individual that might have other things that they want to do outside of what they are doing in terms of private business
we would not want that person deprived of that opportunity to go to sustainable development say for an economic development program
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister anawak
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
thank you mr chairman
the reason i said that was that lets say i know that you talked about the start of the costs as to what mr irqittuq was saying before
i can say the reason i said that is it is in small communities you do not get this type of opportunities to start a business
when i say business i am also including the things that you said about healing and counselling and so on
so you will be hiring some elders to do that also aside from your own business for example
in outpost camps they want to develop before they can look after themselves by making some let say making good profit out of it and then go on to something else
i am also saying that there is also an opportunity i hope you are not saying it is not but i can see it coming in the future once you say that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister
hon jack anawak
we are open to suggestions because i am sure that maybe a person is about to look after some people maybe they don t have the wisdom for lack of a better word to provide counselling or home care type
those are the kind of things that we would want to look at
while we maybe are not doing it right now we want to look for ways to lessen the population in the correctional facilities
if there are opportunities where we could provide a better system that is what we look for
we are open to any suggestion and any discussions on how we could provide a better service then in place of a correctional facility
but we realize there will always be a need for correction facilities but the more we can do things outside of a correctional facility as long as we ensure their safety we are open to ideas
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
any further questions or general comments
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this is more of a comment then a question
at times some people have been incarcerated for years
what can we do to provide support to children of these inmates because a lot of the children do not know whether they have fathers because their father had been gone for a long time
in the inuit tradition there is always room for improving a person but when a person has been incarcerated for years you have pity for the children and the mother s of these children and the wives of these inmates might get married to somebody else
it is not always the case but it does happen
what kinds of plans to you have to provide a support system for the families of the inmates
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we have realised it for a long time and it finally sunk in while i was a member of parliament and i went to go visit the borden penitentiary in alberta
i went there twice to see the inmates and afterwards i realised some of the inmates or all of the inmates that i went to see never got visitors
these were the inuit population and there were about sixty in total in the borden penitentiary
there was one inuk elder who worked there and went to see the inmates but the rest of the population never got a visitor from any of their family members
at that time i realised that they did not only not get visitors from their families but you realize that when these inmates finally went home there was going to be no improvement
there was going to be a deteriorating environment for inmates returning home
sometimes when they went home i am not saying all of them but some of the inmates when they returned home would have a deteriorated setting
no more material things
all the things that they had were gone and those who were married might have separated from their spouse
if the wife had the children and the father would be alienated from the family that he once had
it finally sunk in to me when i went to visit the penitentiary and the total inuit population was about sixty and the total population was about 7 hundred
the total population of inuit was sixty and some of these inmates who did not come from the nunavut area would get visitors from their families
they would get visitors from their wives and their children and their relatives and friends
but the inuit population could not get visitors from their friends and relatives
but they weren t visited because the expense was too high to go and see them
because of these profound effects at the penitentiary we have been doing something better than the lifestyle of the inmates through our healing programs and that is one of the reason for saving up for a facility in nunavut
for summary convictions and possibly while they are here and the facility is established in nunavut they will stay in touch with their families or family members
because a lot of the population down south get separated from their immediate families because of the length of their sentences their spouses find somebody else
so we have to look at ways and means of how we can improve the lives of inuit inmates and how they can come back to a better environment or possibly having visits from their relatives so they can come home to a friendlier environment we also have to realise that if the man was sent to a penitentiary without resolving the problem the spousal problem they might very well come back to the same situation
so we are looking at the ways and means to improve the lifestyle of the inmates i am not talking about all of them but some of them are sentenced to years of incarceration and even when their lives could have improved if they had alternative means of being sentenced they could improve
if they are just put in a penitentiary and if they got visits things would not deteriorate as bad
but because they do not get visits from their relatives they deteriorate so we are looking at ways to improve the facility we want to also look at how the inmates can get visits
sometimes we go see the inmates down in pembrooke and we are looking at how we can improve the system because to many inmates who could have had a better environment don t have anything to come home to it is a friendless environment and having been in jail for a while is a shameful thing in front of the people
not only for the inmate himself but the whole community
so we have to look at ways that we can improve the system
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak for your wise words
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairman
that is very clear thank you
at times i think about the men being incarcerated and sometimes their wives find somebody else and the children are left somewhere in between
they are not bonded with their mother and they have a stepfather
there are social ills
thank you for responding to my question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
i do not see any more comments or general questions but if you would like to respond mr anawak please do so
hon jack anawak interpretation
the reason i mentioned the spouses is for a reason but of course there are the children that are hurt possibly because their father is taken away for five years and they can t go see him
the facility is too far away
if that child is small he might forget who his father is and if that child was in the south they could have weekly visits with their fathers but when you are up here sometimes inmates don t get visited for 5 years either by their wives or their children
so we are looking at how we can improve that
inuit family ties are very strong and it is an abrupt cut when contact with the immediate family of the inmate is severed
i do know that we will never have enough money to do what we want to do in nunavut
we have to be close to the people of nunavut and make improvements
i realize that some of the inmates did very hurtful things but not all of them
some times there is a hurt point and you overcome it and in the justice system a person is charged and usually at that time there is always room for reconciliation between the man and the wife but they are not given the opportunity and they will not see each other anymore
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
if it is ok with the members
i would like to put mr akesuk as chairperson of the committee of the whole
if you do not mind if you can take the chair
i have some questions i would like to ask
thank you
mr akesuk hot seat
interpretation mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i will talk about my community in particular
there has been a mistake made and this individual has been arrested and charged
it was a mistake done and it must be very hard for the individual
if somebody makes a mistake what happens to him or her
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
this is separate item altogether and i am not in the liberty to say anything about it at this time
if there has been a mistake and the individual is charged then it is the responsibility of my staff taken on individual bases
if the person is charged and has to go through the court system yes they could say it was a wrongful arrest and wrongful incarceration
but this has nothing to do with us
it has to go through the other system
perhaps if the individual could talk with our staff besides myself then they can talk one to one
because we can not talk one to one to the individual but the mla could talk with my staff to resolve this problem that happened to the individual
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes ok i understand that
when we were meeting in rankin inlet during a session
there is an elderly person that bumped somebody else s vehicle
when he did not know what happened
he was charged and because he bumped into somebody else s vehicle and without the individual knowing what he did wrong
then it is very wrong to charge somebody and for someone to go to court
what happens to those people
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
those are the types of things that we can not do anything about as long as they have been charged already
there is nothing that we can do as a justice department
but perhaps people have been charged for petty things such as this
wrongfully charged because what they have done
what they do is they are dealt with the justice of the peace
the individual that is elderly or older person and without intentionally doing something for us the inuit people it is easy for us to apologise for not doing something intentionally
once the person is already charged there is no other way but to go through the courts
i understand where mr iqaqrialu is coming from
because the justice system is so different from the inuit traditional way of doing things
these are the things that we are looking into
but we can not do anything about it once the person is charged
but they have no other course but to go through the court system
what we are doing is we are trying to look into this so we can do it in a better way
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes i understand what he is talking about and i have no more comments
i think you can come back to your chair
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
my question is about the laws of the federal government
i guess the federal legislation is it impossible to amend the federal legislation as a nunavut government
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
in english it says we can not change the criminal code of canada
i know that if there is someone that is going to perhaps amend the criminal code of canada then we have to be involved as a government
we can not do anything about it
we can amend the legislation that we as the nunavut government provide to the people
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
because we can not change the legislation and if the federal government does not like the legislation we make here in nunavut
i guess we will have to amend our legislation
i guess
would we be asked to go to court in order to if they were to sue us something like that because of the legislation that we make
chairperson interpretation
mr anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
we are under the federal legislation as the mlas
so as a government if we are going to produce a legislation we can not break the federal laws
but the laws we are making as a legislature of nunavut we still working with the government of canada
so we would not be getting into the problem of mr akesuk is talking about because we have to work with them
we have to look at the legislation carefully if we are not breaking the federal laws
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
mr chairperson i will be asking this in english to the minister of justice
it is about the hay river drug treatment program
interpretation ends to residents of nunavut through government of nunavut health and social services
people from all walks of life can go there
people going to this treatment centre from correction institution keep getting a weekly allowance while those are going to their court are not receiving any allowance
could the minister perhaps with the assistance of health and social services minister clarify for us how the situation came to be
why would a correctional institution inmate get preferential treatment over people that are not there under court order or such other order
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
perhaps it is the department of health and social services responsibility to take care part of the question your asking
if there were going to be a program such as the one in hay river then it would be under the responsibility of health and social services minister
as the department of justice dealing with drug and alcohol treatment
we can not do it at this time
perhaps it would be under our jurisdiction if we were asked to provide assistance in regards to anything related to justice system
but we can not
if there were someone that wants to go to hay river treatment centre then it would have to go through the department of health and social services
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
is there anyway to say for instance an individual from nunavut would they be able to attend that treatment centre
or an individual that has been incarcerated and they get 30 dollars a day
would that individual be able to or for anyone from the public
i just wonder why they would not be able to go down to the treatment centre for treatment
chairperson interpretation
mr minister anawak
hon jack anawak interpretation
the ones that have to get some assistance through our department are the ones that are at this time
say for instance
i will use this as an example
we have been discussing with the department of health and social services
there is a place called inusiqsiurvik and we would like to be able to utilise this
we were recently in talks with health and social services
we will look in other directions to see whether we can assist the people that might go through the justice department that have problems with drugs and alcohol
that want to get assistance
we have nothing to do with them at this time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
any more comments
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairperson
i am looking at the department s business plan
the environmental scan states that nunavut compares badly in relation with the rest of canada
specifically with the following crime rates
notably the violent crime number of persons remanded before trial incarceration rates and the youthful age of the offender population
it goes on to say without improved social and justice related services for all the people of nunavut in communities particularly for the young these problems will not likely decrease or will it continue to increase
in the department principles one of them is on crime prevention and community wellness
it talks about the co operation with other nunavut departments
the value of harmony of working together with other stakeholders
i am just wondering if the department has initiated any types of plans to work with other departments
health and social services or culture language elders  youth in trying to come up with some type of a joint concerted plan of attack to try and help address these issues
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
hon jack anawak
thank you mr chairperson
again we look for ways to see how we can help those to cut the crime rate down
we do have applications for more funding for crime prevention programs
we have not yet got to the point of full discussions with other departments
again part of it is that while we are pretty well set up and running
i am not sure whether other departments are fully set up yet
once that happens say a department of culture language elders  youth
then we would want to get into a full discussion about how do we compliment each other in crime prevention or assistance or whether the department of health and social services how can we help
right now the one thing we have done is in the budget we are asking for 450 thousand dollars to place to have 4 probation officers for nunavut
one of whom would be in iqaluit
another one would be somewhere in the baffin
one in the keewatin
one in the kitikmeot
realising that is not enough at the same time that is the only amount of money we can get right now
what we would like to do is continue to get more money in the later years to get more probation officers in order to work better with say the department of health and social services
because right now what happens is the social workers in most communities act as the victim support helpers as well as counselling the perpetrator which is a contradiction
so what we are trying to do is assist and get full probation officers which would have responsibilities outside of that community
in order to elevate the work that is done by the social worker
so as i said right now we have not got to the point of full discussions with other departments
but we expect to do that as soon as the departments are up and running fully
as i said we are doing this
we are continuing to try to get more funding for crime prevention
what we want to also make sure is that we are looking at other ways of dealing with crimes and not necessarily
i mentioned in rankin inlet at the time
rankin inlet was trying to do a diversion protocol where in some cases and only with the approval of the victim
if a spousal assault occurred we might try to work out some other ways of coming to a conclusion
a positive conclusion
if it can be done with the spouse
we are continuing to seek funding under the community wellness program
so what we are trying to do is make a positive spin into this
the kind of things that always tend to work against the population as a whole
because of the justice system they are not culturally relevant
in some cases not culturally relevant
we do have the justice system that is what we have to live with
but we are trying to find ways to do more to cut crime but also to put more emphasis on healing and treatment
so again we hope to have full discussions with the health and social services and culture language elders  youth and sustainable development to find out more ways of cutting down on crime and assisting more with healing and treatment
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
i can appreciate the minister comments on the magnitude
i know it is not an easy thing that can be dealt with right away
i am just wondering if my guess the approach would be to sit down with the other departments and trying to find areas that are a common concern or common nature the department of justice shares with some of the other areas in coming up these
probably the hardest part would be just sitting down to try to identify these areas of what they are
once that is done maybe give a clearer picture or a better idea what can be done in those areas
i do not mean a commitment of time whatever right now
i would like to ask the minister if that is the stage the plan they are trying in the future
at some point in the future could they provide the members with a list of areas like that that are common to share a common concern with the other departments
if anything just for you know where we may have some ideas or suggestions once we see that information and we can pass it on to the department
something that might be helpful
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
minister anawak
he stated that it does not mind if you do not have a response for him
if you like to respond mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
to assure members of the legislative assembly that yes we will be continuing to have discussions with other departments and any measures we are going to put forward
if we want to make sure of course we want to make sure with the support of the members
the way we will get it is by keeping the members informed
so any measures we will undertake in terms of what we just discussed
we will not only provide the members with the information but also ask for assistance
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
at this point i do not have any more names on my list

mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have one question that was just given to me recently
why is it that the department of justice pays 30 dollars per day per inmate
is this for when they are in a detox centre
the reason this question came up was that the people who go to the detox centre are paid a per diem but the inmates who take the program are paid 30 dollars a day
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr minister
hon jack anawak interpretation
we misunderstood a little bit
we do not have any per diem payments for inmates who take the program
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr anawak
mr anawak supplementary
hon jack anawak interpretation
we will just look into it because i do not believe that we pay a per diem for inmates

thank you

thank you mr kilabuk minister of sustainable development
since he is ready do you agree
you can then begin
mr minister
department of sustainable development
minister s opening remarks
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am very pleased to present the department of sustainable development s main estimates for 20002001
before beginning my remarks i would like to introduce you to my team of officials who will be supporting my appearance today
i am sorry some of them are not present at this time
perhaps when we get to the witness table i will introduce them to you
there will be katherine trumper deputy minister
peter ittinuar assistant deputy minister jim martin director of corporate services and mr joe tigullaraq assistant director of wildlife
a year ago i spoke to the committee about initiating a review of this department s programs policies and its legislation
to do this i needed to talk with nunavummiut
so this year i travelled to each region of nunavut and heard about the issues and the opportunities
throughout this past year i began formulating a map for the department of sustainable development the beginning of which is the 20002001 budget which you have before you
i am not really sure who i am talking to
mr chairman the department of sustainable development s budget for 20002001 is 33 million 835 thousand which is 5 of the total government expenditures
on pages 11   3 to 11   5 of the main estimates you will find the department  operations and maintenance budget
we have made adjustments to the operations and maintenance budget this year to accommodate some new initiatives in the department s budget
i just want to ask the chairman whether i should continue or not with my opening remarks
chairperson interpretation
we have many items to cover
perhaps if we could take a brief recess and then continue with the minister s opening remarks when we have a quorum
we will take a ten minute break at this time
committee recessed at 254 and resumed at 312 pm
chairperson interpretation
members of the legislative assembly we create problems when we do not have a quorum
perhaps when the rest of the members get into the house i will give you a brief message
for those members that are over here
i wonder if they can come into the house back into the house
we have the obligation to deal with the main estimates
we have to continue with the orders of the day
so i wonder if the members could come back to the house
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i do not mind to go ahead with the opening remarks by sustainable development minister because the rest of the members have other items to deal with
so we will not have to vote at this time
the minister of sustainable development can continue
it is a short day it is not a long day
so i think we should continue
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr premier for your comments
during the voting of members
the members have to be present in the house
after the minister makes his opening comments then usually questions come from the members
we were voted into nunavut legislature in order to do our job and we have to sit in the house in the meantime
so according to that i think all the members should try to be present in the house when we are discussing very important topics such as the main estimates
thank you
we now have a quorum
the minister of sustainable development mr kilabuk can you go ahead with your opening remarks
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
perhaps if i can start where we took a break
the operations  maintenance budget
mr chairperson i made brief comments about the 2000 2001 main estimates 33 million 835 thousand
on pages 11 3 to 11 5 of the main estimates
you will find the departments operations  maintenance budget we have made adjustments to the operations  maintenance budget this year to accommodate new initiatives in the departments budget
one of those initiatives relates to the bathurst mandate
commitment of capacity building
mr chairperson one of the topics that were raised in virtually every community i travelled to this year was made for the department to provide greater support community based staff that deliver the department s programs
these are the community economic development officers who we support through direct contributions to hamlets and our wildlife officers
who are government of nunavut employees the 2000 2001 budget sets aside 175 thousand dollars for strengthening or supporting to community economic development officers
three hundred and fifty thousand for training and development in nunavut wildlife service
and mr chairperson we have reduced the 2000 2001 headquarters operations  maintenance budget in order to support 3 new economic initiatives for this government
the first of these initiatives is the implementation of our nunavut sealing strategy
which i have previously announced in this house and the fisheries strategy aimed at gaining greater access to the fish stock off our shores
we have budgeted 100 thousand dollars for this purpose
the second economic initiative relates to nunavut mining sector
last year members will recall the department s budget set aside new dollars for canada nunavut geo science office
for the nunavut prospectors program
over the winter we completed analysis of opportunity in nunavut s mining sector in addition the investment of this government must make to prepare in nunavummiut for these opportunities
in 2000 2001 we have set aside 125 thousand for mobilisation initiatives for the mining sector
the third economic initiative deals with giving nunavummiut an opportunity at work experience
mr chairperson almost 20 years ago i gained my first experience in the labour force through a short term employment program known as the step program
last year i directed my officials to examine the range of existing programs that support the entry of people into the labour force and how we can facilitate access to those programs for community projects
in 2000 2001 we have set aside 175 thousand dollars to continue to set up our nunavut job corp network so that more nunavummiut can gain experience in the work force
mr chairperson 11 6 to 11 10 you will find the description of the departments grants and contribution which totals 13 million 168 thousand dollars or 43 percent of the departments operations  maintenance budget
these grants and contribution form the core of the departments core grant commitment
as members are aware on april 1 1999 we assume responsibility for the community based business operating under the nunavut development corporation
we are proposing a budget of 2 million 865 thousand for the nunavut development corporation this year and we will undertake of the operation
i am pleased that our contracting arrangement with the government of the northwest territories for the administration of the nunavut business credit corporation is now concluded and we have this important loan program home to nunavut this year
we are proposing a budget of 371 thousand dollars to establish and administer its operation in year 2000 2001
the nunavut business credit corporation is currently reviewing its role in lending environment in nunavut
so i hope to be able to report on this progress of this review this fall
we are also proposing to continue support for the community futures program this year
which provides loans under 75 thousand dollars
mr chairperson the department of sustainable development delivers a number of programs in partnership with other agencies
the list of grants and contributions on page 11 7 to 11 8 reflects on going commitment to those partnerships
in 2000 2001 our partnership will include the nunavut arts and craft association 100 thousand
nunavut tourism 1 million 185 thousand
and the canada nunavut geo science office for 450 thousand dollars
under grants and contribution on pages 11 6 to 11 9 you will also see that we are continuing assist programs individuals and communities in realising their ideas for developing the economy
our expenditures in these areas remain almost stable at 330 thousand for grants to small business program in the amount of 150 thousand for the nunavut prospectors program 859 thousand for the business development program and 240 thousand for support of commercial fisheries
mr chairperson we are also extending our funding commitment to nunavut communities to develop and implement their own economic plans and projects by allocating 2 million 890 thousand dollars under the community initiative fund
during standing committee and throughout my travels this year i have heard general support for my departments partnerships with communities and service deliver agencies
providing we are clear in the purpose and performance objectives
thus mr chairperson early this year i will be releasing a policy on program partnership that will seek to strengthen the terms under which we will support these partnerships
mr chairperson i have also incorporated in this year s budget a major initiatives in wildlife
as members know this government along with our partners nunavut tunngavik incorporated and the nunavut wildlife management board is committed to the development of wildlife legislation
that is appropriate for nunavut
200 thousand dollars have been built into the budget this year for the extensive consultations that will be required to develop nunavut s own wildlife act
the first wildlife legislation in canada to reflect a co management regime
in addition mr chairperson the department 2000 2001 budget also reflects our on going commitment to our partners in wildlife management
the grants and contribution budget on page 11 7 details our commitment to hunters and trappers organizations in nunavut 303 thousand dollars
regional wildlife boards for 223 thousand dollars
last month i launched a review on harvesters support programs
the results of which i expect to have this fall
in the interim we are maintaining our level of support to individuals harvesters through our policy on grants and contribution in support of harvesters
mr chairperson before i conclude
i want to speak briefly about the department s capital plan for 2000 2001
the department has a capital plan for three purposes
the first purpose is to support the on going requirements of the nunavut wildlife service in replacing equipment used in monitoring enforcement and training
we have budgeted 860 thousand for this year 2000 2001
the second purpose of our capital plan is to invest in the developing nunavut tourism industry
mr chairperson a successful tourism industry is built up through small investment in such things as information signs and the development of attractions such as thule sites and camp grounds and exhibits in our airports and visitors centres
we have budgeted 1 million 665 thousand in this 2000 2001
i am also pleased to advise you that we have commenced our negotiations with nunavut tunngavik incorporated on the inuit impact benefits agreements
for our territorial parks and hope to be able to conclude these negotiations later this year
the third purpose of our capital plan is to support our traditional economy through the display of arts and crafts in public buildings throughout nunavut and we have budgeted 175 thousand for this purpose
when the public interest is building they should be greeted with showcase of artists that brings recognition to the important contribution they make to our economy
mr chairperson this is the summery of the department of sustainable development budget for 2000 2001
i would be very pleased to answer questions at this time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister of sustainable development
chairperson of the standing committee mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i am pleased to be able to make some opening remarks as we begin the debate of the 2000 2001 main estimates for the department of sustainable development
over the past year the standing committee has had an opportunity to meet with the minister on a number of occasions
mr chairperson the standing committee has been impressed with the energy that the department has placed in a number of initiatives over the past year
given the high importance that all members place on building economic opportunity in all of our communities large and small and given the need to address the unacceptably high levels of unemployment in nunavut the standing committee is supportive of the thrust the departments efforts
over the coming year the standing committee will follow closely the progress made in both the nunavut economic forum and the minister s forum on the economy
it is our hope that both initiatives generate concrete action plans
we would express the same sentiment with respect to the nunavut job corps initiative
the committee has taken not of the commitment in the departments business plan to review the grants and contributions policies of the department in the past year members of the standing committee have expressed concerns over the accountability of the dollars spent in grants and contributions
however members of the standing committee have expressed concerns on a number of occasions with the minister over the value for money that nunavut receives from the 11 million dollars that the department provides annually to the nunavut tourism in core funding
with respect to the department s 2000 2001 capital plan the standing committee will seek clarification as to the criteria that will be used to determine in which community the centre will be located
the standing committee has also taken note of the fact that the final capital estimates document does not lay out the future years  cost of a number of projects
individual members are also likely to raise a number of concerns regarding the capital priorities of the department
mr chairperson these are some of the general areas of concern that we have had as a standing committee
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you chairperson of the standing committee
we are now on sustainable development perhaps the minister and his two officials can go down to the witness table
mr barnabas mr barnabas interpretation
mr chairperson we will be asking questions once the members go to the witness table
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas mr minister for sustainable development and the rest of his officials can go down to the table
thank you for coming down to the witness table mr minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk could you introduce your officials for the record please
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
as i stated earlier that i will be with kathryn trumper to my right and to my left mr ittinuar the assistant deputy minister
and also couple of more officials sitting at the gallery joe tigullarak assistant director for wildlife and also the person sitting next to him jim martin director of corporate services so these are my officials for today mr chairperson
thank you mr minister for sustainable development the floor is open for general comments
thank you mr chairperson mr chairperson i know we will be dealing with the main estimates but i would like to make a general comment mr chairperson
we were able to make an agreement between pond inlet and arctic bay about the proposed parks when they were working on the proposed parks
but pond inlet and arctic bay residence if they could use the parks for commercial purposes
that was the only way we could approve it and looking at the budget
they are only allocating some funds to pond inlet
there is none for arctic bay
so my question is why that is the case
thank you chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas minister for sustainable development mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation perhaps just to elaborate to you why they are not included in the main estimates
the territorial parks within nunavut under the jurisdiction of the nunavut government yes we do have responsibility for those but for the parks are under the jurisdiction of the federal government on national parks
they have that responsibility too to allocate funds because they are under the responsibility
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister kilabuk
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to ask a different question
it is 225 thousand on the proposed natural resource centre the first time and now it is different with 225 thousand is still the same
is that going to be used for the feasibility study
my question is when the government initiates a feasibility study it can easily expend 15 thousand dollars you have 225 thousand dollars for a feasibility study
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it is the same when we appeared before the standing committee
i know for some units being built it is more expensive units this is for the most expensive figure but it will be used for a feasibility study and the operation will be in there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman 225 thousand for one fiscal year would be used for a feasibility study what kind of plan are you going to be studying for 225 thousand
usually 15 thousand dollars is expended for such studies
why do we need such an expensive feasibility study
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister for sustainable development
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes the department of sustainable development would not be working alone but they would have to be working along with other people if we can come up with a natural resource training centre
we would have to work in partnership with education and as to these people are working in the training centres will be used and how the design will be and all these are for that planning study
we recognize that the development officers and the renewable resource officers are part wardens as to who would have to utilise the training centre and how much planning and everything is included that is why you see that kind of figure
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
mr chairperson yes we approved under the department of education budget i had not seen any funding from the department of education
whether the department of education would work in partnership with the department of sustainable development for training purposes
perhaps the minister for education did not allot money to your department or maybe you have not negotiated with the minister for the training part of the training centre
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we still have not initiated any study yet but we have budgeted for 225 thousand dollars for the feasibility study and we will work with all the people we will be collaborating with
we will find out who we should be collaborating with at this point
i would like all the people we will be working with to approve the plan after a year
especially after a year the department of fisheries and oceans under the jurisdiction of the federal government in ottawa and we will also be appearing in front of that federal department on how we can find the best solution for nunavut
we will be working with the departments that will have an impact on our department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
as some of the members represent smaller communities we are looking at initiatives that are implemented by the government and what we are looking for is to get more benefits going into the communities and therefore more jobs
this money is set aside to build a proposed natural resources centre
i would like to know what type of criteria you will use in order to find out where you will build this training centre
that is my question thank you mr speaker
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
like i said earlier i am going to be working with the other departments when we are talking about the proposed natural resource training centre
on the location of the centre where it is going to be located
during these discussions we are going to figure out who we are going to be working with
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like clarification from the minister
i do know that our premier has this portfolio the decentralization portfolio and there is going to be benefits going out to the various communities and with the decentralization plan the ones who lose out are the smaller communities
they have lots of renewable resource officers and offices but it is usually one person that is employed by that department
when the nunavut construction corporation was building staff housing there were more people employed from the larger communities than the smaller communities
the smaller communities that did not get decentralized departments did not even get some of their population employed by ncc
they were ready and willing to work but they could not pay for their airfare or their expenses that were required in order to gain that employment
i would like to know what is going to be in this for the smaller communities thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in regards to the discussion about the smaller communities
we are not just concentrating on the smaller communities we are looking at the operation and the location of this training centre
we are going to be looking at the feasibility study part and parcel of that is the location and of course we will be considering the employment factor
like everything else and then form there we will be taking all these into consideration
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
for those in the communities they do not have any jobs and they have trouble with money and by trying to get a job or start their own business
they have problems with equity when they want to have their own business
interpretation ends also to put the application through the system let us say sustainable development or the regional economic development offices i am wondering if the department has looked at this before
how do we help individuals that have a really good idea
a business plan that they can put in place
before they come up with that equity a business comes up from down south i just given this as an example coming from down south and saying i got the equity i will do it
so the people in the community lose out on that opportunity
so i am just trying to get some information or some ideas so you can address that in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
it is a very good example with what happens at the communities with many people out there that have excellent business ideas and plans but the only problem they have is start up funds which are lacking
there is many ideas that do not get started because a lack of equity
in the nunavut regions the kitikmeot the keewatin and the baffin there is the regional inuit associations and the funding agencies that provide contributions or part of the funds for small businesses
they are able to give financial assistance to the people who have business ideas
we are also going to be looking at the issue to support the people out there
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr havioyak
mr havioyak
maybe i should just give an example here and it might be able to help both of us so we can be on the same level there
okay the individual has a 100 thousand dollar project in total
the individual has to have equity of ten percent hopefully it is 2 percent in the future 10 thousand dollars is a lot of money and people cannot come up with that 10 thousand dollars
i am wondering if there is a percentage that you will be working with in the future or working with the other organizations that work with economic development projects
i guess i am just looking for an answer where we can say are we looking at these equity percentages lowered so we can assist these individuals in the future
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i would like to remind everyone that our grants and contributions from our department are going to be reviewed this coming year
of course your comments are going to be included in this review as we have stated earlier to the members
also to the mayors in the upcoming months we hope to have a closer working relationship so we can redirect or re route our grants and contributions that come from our department
the example that mr havioyak used is going to be part of the review but i cannot say at this point exactly until that review is done
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
i am the chairperson so i cannot very well ask you some questions
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the axel hieghburg island is going to be provided 25 thousand dollars and i do know it would not be funded if it did not go through the media or if we did not bring it up as an issue
iqaluit is growing at a rapid past as the capital of nunavut
there is almost 500 thousand that will be used and there is 275 thousand for the development of the sylvia grinnell park and 200 thousand dollars for the renovation for the unikaavik visitors centre
that is approximately half a million dollars that will be used for iqaluit where there is a lot smaller portions slotted for the other communities
why is that the case that is my question
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in our review we have found out that tourists that go up to the arctic from the south usually don t come back if there is no facilities or attractions in the community that they visited to
one thing that we have heard from the tourists is that iqaluit is the transportation hub and we thought there has to be something for the tourists to see so that they will want to go a little bit further to the smaller communities
in our plan we are looking at ways and means of how we can attract tourists and how we can have the tourists stay up here longer and we have found it is going to be an incentive for the tourists to stay longer
so that is what we are building on
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
looking at the 5 year plan the smaller communities are trying to generate some revenues through tourism
there are businesses in iqaluit and outfitters and there is baffin tourism here
although we try to build up on our tourism level in the smaller communities there have to be facilities and attractions built for the tourists
why is it that the smaller communities have 20 thousand to 50 thousand in the plan and there is one for 275 thousand for iqaluit and again 200 thousand for another project
looking at the 5 year plan it is about 3 million dollars that will be used and then looking at the smaller communities are they not going to get any funding in that 5 year plan
they will need that money in order to attract their tourists and build up their tourism
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
with these entities we are working together and i am not going to belittle the smaller communities
the smaller communities in nunavut are provided with funding i will point out the smaller communities have been given money to build campsites
there are some that have better established camp sites and if you look at the capital estimates there are different camp sites
looking at iqaluit we are setting up a park and that is a little bit different than the campgrounds that are established in all the communities
looking at the plans we have to help the tourism sector in iqaluit because it is the transportation hub and everything passes through here before they enter the rest of nunavut
it is for iqaluit the money is set aside for iqaluit but it is an attraction that will decentralize to the other communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
before we move on to mr barnabas somebody would like to make a comment
mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you for passing that over
mr chairperson i just like to briefly a few individuals that have come over from cambridge bay
we have with us charlie evalik who is president of the kitikmeot inuit association
mayor keith peterson who members met with last night
also claire basler who is the general manager of the kitikmeot corporation
a former constituent and one of the eia staff right now david general who is accompanying them right now
applause
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr ng and welcome to the gallery
mr barnabas i am sure you remember your question
mr barnabas interpretation
again in the standing committee on sustainable development in the opening remarks it says here there is going to be 225 thousand dollars set aside for the visitors centre in rankin inlet 22 million dollars will be spent on that project
why is it so expensive
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas that will be an excellent question when we start the going line by line in the capital estimates
mr kilabuk if you would like to respond to that question
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
in our 5 year plan we have 250 thousand dollars
i believe that is the question that you are referring to
we wanted to set aside some money for this particular project because there has to be renovations and replacements done on campgrounds
there are quite a lot of laces like that in the nunavut area
thank you mr chairman
chairperson thank you mr kilabuk mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
i do not think that minister and i understand one another
i am talking about the 125 thousand dollars that will be used this year to build a visitors centre in rankin inlet
it is 205 million dollars in the capital plan
i believe there is already a visitors  centre in rankin inlet what is that money going to be used for
chairperson interpretation
i apologise at this moment i will give you general discretion minister of whether you want to ask that question or not
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
i apologise we were on different wave lengths i did not know that he was talking about rankin inlet s visitor centre
rankin inlet is the transportation hub in the keewatin and it is is one of the communities that do not have a visitors  information centre and the facility that they have which is located in the airport is quite small
as rankin inlet is the transportation hub in the keewatin we have included it in the plans
we have recently agreed if you have heard that we are in the negotiation stage to develop a proposed park in wager bay
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
ms thompson i believe would like to supplement that ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to note that in rankin inlet there is no visitors  centre or tourism centre
the reason why they put it in the rankin inlet airport is because this room was used for security but because tourism did not have an office they put the office in there
it is supposed to be a security area for the airlines going down south
i just wanted to make that clear to the members
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you ms thompson
mr barnabas do you have any more questions
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
yes mr chairman
mr chairman during questioning of witnesses i have not had much opportunity to ask questions and i would like that opportunity now
thank you mr chairman right now the smaller communities don t have any money set aside for them in regards to economic development in their communities but there is a lot of money for the renovations of campgrounds and other areas in the nunavut region
i just wanted to find that out
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman yes perhaps if he could clarify his question
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk mr barnabas he would like you to clarify your question
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes there is money set aside for tourism and there is a lot that is being done for tourism in other regions
i just wanted to know if smaller communities would have the opportunity to get some money
they only have about 25   30 thousand to renovate the existing campgrounds in smaller communities
i just wondered whether they have plans in place for smaller communities to get more money to upgrade their campgrounds and tourism sites
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i cannot really say at this time whether we have any plans in place for the smaller communities but we have some money set aside to promote tourism in those communities that we mentioned
we have to have plans in place to promote tourism so people from the south can start visiting those larger communities in order to get the smaller communities
it is a lot easier to start up in the larger communities first before we get into the smaller communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
yes you are true mr kilabuk
the communities have the opportunities for their needs as well
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the last response that he had is very sensitive for us as well because the smaller communities would like to have the opportunity to get some money to receive tourism dollars as well
the first item that the minister talked about the study that is going to be done and it will cost 220 thousand dollars over a five year period or the natural resources training centre that will cost 225 thousand dollars
it is going to be approximately 3 million dollars to do this study
i think that natural resources training centre was going to be located in pangnirtung and thinking about decentralization this is just a comment not a question
in accordance with the decentralization plan the government stated that they would look at the smaller communities for decentralization but it seems like the larger communities have everything and with more jobs have more money allotted for themselves
you can see it in the budget that is before us
the larger communities that have been given jobs or have more jobs such places as pangnirtung pond inlet baker lake rankin inlet and kugluktuk and cambridge bay are the places that have the most jobs and more decentralized jobs
you can see it by looking at the comments that are made on this paper
if we were to do careful planning the places that should get tourism dollars should have been given elsewhere into the smaller communities but they are given to the larger communities this is just a general comment and a concern that i have
there is not enough money set aside to help people develop small businesses if we were in the 1970 s if the community requested 500 thousand it would have been available to the community
now today because there is not enough money to develop communities and because there are so many rules about spending the money there are not enough dollars for smaller communities
looking at the plan of sustainable development and the five year capital plan there is more money for the larger centres somewhere in the range of 3 million dollars
for the communities that don t have any infrastructure and communities that are not getting decentralized jobs such places as repulse bay coral harbour these are the only small communities that are given some money
it is somewhat embarrassing to see something like this especially in view of the fact that the ordinary members have asked for spending but are not given it
i would propose that the natural resources training centre be located in a smaller community anywhere in nunavut if we are going to be spending that amount of money
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
i did not hear a question mr kilabuk would you like to respond
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the comments made by the member i just wanted to give him a clear understanding and the members of this house that when we were looking at who we were going to be in partnership with in regards to the training centrei am sorry we were not clear
we will be working with the canadian coast guard universities and arctic college and fisheries people
we are not exactly sure where that location might be for the natural resources training centre but when we discussed the location of that training centre the members will have the opportunity to voice their concerns and to be involved in picking the location of that training centre
you will have the opportunity to be involved in the decision of the location
in regards to the comments made about decentralization there are communities at this time that could be the location of decentralized jobs but they have no infrastructure at this time
for the money that they would be requesting to start up a small business when i became the minister i had those concerns as well in this regard
i just want to make it clear to the members that our department is one of the departments that deal with the funding for small businesses
there are also other organizations such as the business credit corporation and kakivak and aboriginal business canada and the banks are some of the places where you can acquire some funding for starting up small businesses
so what i proposed was to work with those organizations to assist people to start businesses and we are starting to work on this now but we are in the early stages at this time and my staff is also aware of what we have been doing
we made and agreement and i have told the members that the department of sustainable development is just starting up their department at this time and any questions from the members to deal with starting up businesses will be welcomed by our department
thank you mr chairman
chairperson mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr iqaqrialu
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i do not want to have a negative impact on private businesses in nunavut but i am going to speak that i believe in and something that i have experienced
i will not be asking questions just making comments
i just want you to be aware of that
in nunavut for those of us who have been living here for a very long time it is not our tradition or culture to work at making money in spite of this we have been abused as inuit people because we are ignorant of economic issues and business issues
in the past we have realised that we were abused and we learned from our mistakes from the past in spite of the actions that have been taken against us for example by temporary residents from the south they did have the opportunities in the past and those opportunities were taken away from the inuit
today we are now learning how to do the administration stuff and being a middle aged inuk person we do not know how to do bookkeeping i know that when you do not know how to do all the administration stuff i know that in the past inuit people have been used
therefore i would like your department to make a plan to treat everyone no matter what race they are to be treated equally and so that opportunities will be equal to all people of nunavut
in the past it has been hard when you run into problems like when people started getting their own private businesses and the staff who worked for the private company would start working for another person or another organization so that they could make more money
i know that business people are very wise and intelligent and they do things behind your back to make money
for that reason as we are learning the business world today there should be more equal opportunities for all the people of nunavut
a problem that i have seen in the past as well is that the correspondence and documents are only written in english as a unilingual inuktitut speaking person when you cannot read english it has been a hindrance for us when we want to start up a business
this will have to be resolved too so that unilingual inuktitut speaking people can apply to start up their own businesses one of the problems that i have also seen in the past is the banks
the financial institutions when people start borrowing money from the bank i know that this has been a problem area for us because when you try to run your own businesses and due to ignorance of administration we were losing money and going bankrupt
so these are the experiences that we have seen i think as inuit people we should be standing up on our own two feet and should have the equal opportunity to start businesses without being abused
today in nunavut in the smaller and the larger communities i know that it is getting harder and harder to make money in the smaller communities because the other people from the outside get the opportunity rather than the local person that hinders the development of the community
those communities would have been developed far more than they are today if the community had been given a fair opportunity i am sure that the smaller communities would have had more opportunity but due to ignorance it did not happen
but as we are learning more and more about the business world we should be given the opportunity to take part and be involved so that unilingual inuktitut speaking people have the same opportunity as english speaking people even all the documents in the system will have to be clear so that our people will understand it and that way there could be a close working relationship and a better social life
i just wanted to point that out i know that i might have effected some businesses but i wanted to speak my feelings thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr iqaqrialu
any general comments mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to point out that we will make the application forms available both in english and inuktitut and they are both available in both languages through our department
the application forms will be uniform all across nunavut and one thing that i understood when i became the minister is that we needed clearer application forms
i am very pleased that this has been completed and these application forms have been sent to the communities
if any of the communities did not receive copies of the application forms they will be receiving them
however through our department our staff in the department understand that the funds that are made available for people will ensure that everyone is treated equally
the economic development officers are available to assist anybody and we would like to train them further so that they will have more knowledge and so that they can assist the people better
thank you mr chairman
chairperson
thank you mr kilabuk mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to talk about
sustainable development in the kitikmeot region because in the past they have helped a lot with wildlife and they have carried out the west kitikmeotslave study
near kugluktuk bay they have helped us a lot too
i am sorry i did not see that person in here
the animals how can we find out how to work on these
i just wanted to find out more about this as to how the federal government and the gnwt who also receive money from them so they can finish off what they are doing with sustainable development
we cannot say some of those words so we will try to help them
some of the work that they have is near kugluktuk cambridge bay bay chimo
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes it is entirely true that it is not included in the budget
the west kitikmeotslave study is not included in the budget but the review has already been ongoing
we do plan to complete it but we will review it outside of our main estimates
it is true that it is not in the main estimates but we will review it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
i am now the chairperson mr havioyak
mr havioyak interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i just wanted to say that if they did get a budget it would be done
it is important for our future in the kitikmeot because we can never find out how our resources are going to be used or planned for but it cannot be done without a budget
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr havioyak
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am sure that we will be able to respond to you by next week or the week after as to what kind of plans we do have i will be able to respond to you by next week or the week after
thank you mr chairman i don t want to ask too many questions to my friend to the rookie minister but that is the only way that i will be able to get clarification is by asking questions
i think it was last year or the year before when we wanted to enhance the carvers and arts and crafts people why did that budget not change
the nunavut arts and craft funding for 100 thousand dollars did not even go up
we stated that we want to assist or give support to the arts and craft people
as members of the legislative assembly we stated we want to give more support to the carvers of nunavut
because it is the only means of their income
we said we want them to give further support and yet the budget has not increased yet
if we can give them further support by increasing the budget why did you not increase the budget
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
yes the 100 thousand dollar program for the nunavut arts and craft association
last year we budgeted 400 thousand dollars for that
but i am very pleased today that the nunavut arts and craft association can lobby
they have been able to sustain themselves and although this 100 thousand dollars may look small
but once we have to recognise nunavut arts and craft association can sustain themselves
they have raised 514 thousand by themselves
which the nunavut government would not have been able to contribute to
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you minister kilabuk mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivauta
i will keep my comments brief i do not need an answer and i will not talk too long to the light of mr picco
i was very pleased with your statement regarding the launch of the arctic traveller
i think that shows a lot of foresight for getting that magazine to the masses to promote and highlight our tremendous new territory
i was extremely pleased to see that nunavut tourism achieved 40 million dollars with additional spin offs of 10
which brings us to a total of 50 million dollars that nunavut tourism had a hand to bring into the new territory
i have been one of the harshest critics on tourism asking as you know in the standing committee meetings and other meetings
are we getting a buck from this organisation
seeing this figure of close to 50 million dollars of tourism dollars brought in from the south or from outside those are new dollars that create economic opportunities in this territory
i am extremely pleased that nunavut tourism has contributed
they are not fully responsible for this 50 million dollars brought in
however i think i am satisfied now for that 11 million dollars that we gave to them that they brought in close to 50 million dollars worth of economic spin offs
how you come to that figure or how they came to this figure i would certainly like to see it
you can probably justify it or they can justify it how they brought in that 50 million or contributed to bring in that amount
they also seem they were going to bring in have some survey done this summer at the airports
how many tourists we bring into nunavut
try to approximate how many dollars
i will ask a question later about if they brought in 50 million dollars
i think that is one of our best investments that we ever done
we have only been in business for a year in this territory
but if they brought in that kind of money we should give them 2 or 3 million dollars so they can make 150 million dollars
i would certainly approve that if i was on the standing committee
i have to commend you that 50 million dollars does not sound like a lot of money outside of this territory but inside this territory if that money is indeed being spent on hotels airfares and arts and crafts things like that
it is a certainly job well done
you all know what i was saying about nunavut tourism over the last year
so you know if they generated 50 million dollars or they were instrumental or they were involved in generating this kind of revenue into nunavut i think they are doing a good job at this point
i would like to certainly see them give an extra boost or some added help to increase that
because like your statement says that the tourism business is estimated at 455 billion us which is probably 700 billion canadian
if we can get one percent of that we would be further ahead than most organisations
i will be looking to see next year how much that increases
like i say we have been getting a lot of promotion from the world on the creation of nunavut and i can suspect it will increase
it says here that sustainable development has been discussing with nti and northern affairs canada that the development of an economic agreement with nunavut
the business plan states that an economic package for the three northern territories expect to be considered by the federal cabinet late this year and early next year
do you anticipate that there will be an additional dollars from the federal government into this program and how much

hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i would like to thank the member for asking that question
the department of sustainable development is not going to be the only department working on this issue
the contributions that we got from the federal government are the ones that are requested are going through negotiations at this time with the federal government
our leaders will again be speaking with the other party sometime this month
we are just going through the negotiation stage at this time and i can not give you a definite answer at this point
i can tell you we are negotiating and if we do come to an agreement
i will keep members up to date
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivauta there was a comment you made in may in setting up the minister s forum on the economy
the old government did about 15 of them every 5 years and we studied the territory to death nunavut and the nwt
all it has benefited minister forum on the economy is the high priced consultants walking away where between 300 500 thousand dollars for studies that sit on desks and shelves and other offices
it really never get around to what is really going to accomplish or what it going to do
maybe wish will can may
can you guarantee to me that this minister forum on the economy is not going to be another one of these dog and pony shows that goes off travels nunavut and we are all going to hear the same thing
we need to create employment
we need more money for the traditional economy
we need more benefits for the smaller communities
we can go on and on and on
is this another study that is going to cost us 2 or 300 thousand dollars that could have been spent wisely someplace else
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr mclean mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson interpretation ends
no
there are no consultants in this process
all the mayors and the members of the legislative assembly are invited to this meeting
this is one we identified the need
it is to revisit our program delivery in grants and contribution to see if we should be looking at making improvements in some of the programs or services
at the end of the meeting we want to use this information and input from the mayors and the members if there are recommendations to start adjusting our programs
to meet the needs of nunavummiut
so we are really confident and looking forward to holding this meeting
which is our commitment as part of our identifying the government and operations in nunavut
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister mr mclean
you can keep asking questions until they are finished
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na itsivauta
you are very generous to me today
you must have got a good easter
on another topic is i do not know if anyone else has experienced it but in my region there is a little frustration with the role where this department is going and what it is doing
people are confused between the land claim agreement and their roles financially and the roles of this government
we all know that the land claim was settled for 580 million dollars and people set aside
nti set aside a certain dollar amount that was used for the beneficiaries only to start up small business
incidentally i have to disagree with my colleagues davidee that inuit are ignorant
if you look around they are running very successful business now
canadian north ntcl sir nunasi
if you look in the kitikmeot you have the development corporations
in the keewatin you have development corporations
over here you have the qikiqtani inuit association and stuff like that
i think they made very wise investments
ten or fifteen years from now they will probably be up there with the royal bank and organisations like that
so there have been very successful businesses in nunavut and they are continuing to grow
yes there is controversy in business
all masses anywhere in society feels they are being trotted by big business
i do not think it is different up here
however getting back to what he was talking about
i agree fully with him and i run into that frustration all the time from people in the street on the complicated process that is involved in starting a small business
sometimes it is easier to start a larger business than it is a small business because of the paper involved and the planning and things like that
i for one say ok you should not throw money at a person who wants to start a business because you set them up to fail
put i know where he is coming from
there are many people out there who have good ideas
whether it is setting up a small carving business a dried fish or dried meat business a wall hanging business a taxi business or whatever
clam digging business
whatever
there seems to be a myriad of bureaucracy that we throw at them
we have cedos in every community and most cases they are bilingual
they are starting to be better at administering programs now they have in the past
i can speak for region that i come from
there are some very good people at the local level involved
the cip program is working effectively as well
i know my frustration comes from when an individual a unilingual individual goes into an office
they come out more perplexed than most people because of what we have
to our benefit the bilingual people in many cases do help
i know in my region there is a quite a few bilingual people that help the unilingual people
most of the time it is just to answer the questions and things like that
it is information that people need
we are suffering from a high unemployment rate even the larger communities as the smaller communities
we have more people in our schools then many these communities have in their population
i have to deal with that coming from a community with a high unemployment rate
so i can understand what my colleagues says when they a lot of paper and stuff like that
it may not be very complicated what they have to do but to have the resources there to make it easier for them to apply or just not discourage them
let them know what they are getting involved in before they go off on a wild goose chase and spend three weeks trying to set up their meat drying business or something like that
the department can look to the hamlets can look or the government can look at if it is a small business under 30 thousand dollars a year or 25 thousand dollars a year
it should be very simplified for them and not get into gst and taxes things like that
if there is someway we can assist the very small individual that want to make a seasonal business
it may be supplying fish to a hotel
we all know what that is like trying to get a permit for them to do that
for a business licence and a grant they need a 5 thousand dollar grant
what they have to go through
it is just little people out there probably appreciate a small grant or a loan just to get going so
i am going to sit here for another three years hoping that their lot will get a little bit better in nunavut because we have promised them that
i really do not need any comments
i think i got my message through to you people
the partnership policies and programs
i fail to accept them yet for some reason
part of the reason why i fail to accept these programs is that it is confusing again to a point where we get this money transferred through third party funding from the federal government but there seems to be another bunch of hoops and stuff people have to jump through and most of it goes back
i was talking to a person in yellowknife last year and he says glenn there is 11 million dollars available
you are probably going to use six or seven
so 5 million dollars goes back to the federal government
it does not go back because they never gave it to us but it is there for us to use
their comment was if you do not use it you are going to loose it
it is probably because of the bureaucratic shuffle again
the federal governments historically throw up everything they can because they design their programs for where the high unemployment is in southern canada
they sometimes try to transplant them here
it does not work but they try to make them work
i think this government has to bend a bit
the nunavut job corp i really would like to see that again
i think that was a good initiative
it helped
here again the smaller communities that are not affected by decentralization
this would be a benefit to them
i come from a decentralized community
we are getting 40 50 jobs
we got 16 hundred people and i am getting
we got 600 students in the schools fifty jobs is a drop in the bucket
that is not going to do it
it is going to be the mining sector it is going to be the tourism sector it is going to be a diversified economy that creates a healthy community
i think i can speak for many communities
it has to be a diversified economy to make it healthy
like the smaller communities like clyde river or arctic bay or something like that
it can not be just one thing it has to be two or three little things
i hope the department will focus and i do not want to put all the emphasis on your department minister kilabuk because you are a small part of the solution
you have the least amount of money to have to come up with the biggest group of answers
i know the members will be here to question the premier on what they are going to get for the smaller communities that are not affected by decentralization
but we have to do a little bit more concentration on this
i hope your forum going into those communities and how you can help them because i genuinely feel for them too
because we know unemployment affects all of us in nunavut
not just the smaller communities or the larger communities
i hope this can come up with a plan working with the community to develop some sort of job strategy in the nunavut job corp could basically help there
along with a bit more money but into tourism training job development because i know these communities out there
i do not want to say who they are
they have a lot to offer in regards to their size and what they can do and seasonal work means a lot
i know when people make two three or five thousand dollars at a seasonal job it means a lot to them because it may be a down payment on a snow machine or an outboard motor
i will be saving myself for some questions later

thank you mr mclean
at this time we would like to have a short break because we made great progress and we will have a break for a 10 minutes
committee recessed 457 and resumed 511 pm
chairperson interpretation
thank you for returning mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
i am sorry i forgot my question
i will use this as an example
the communities that want to take on commercial fishing i wonder how a commercial fisherman would ask to be assisted in a way of funding
for example perhaps to the hunters and trappers association or would they go other departments
would they go to your department to ask for some assistance to get started on commercial fishing
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
the commercial fisherman in nunavut if they want to start up a business in commercial fishing they would go to economic development officers in the communities
if they want to pursue commercial fishing the economic development officers would give us information as to who would like to start commercial fishing in the communities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister kilabuk
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson yes thank you for the response
i just want to make a comment for those communities that are less populated the communities that do not get decentralization
for the larger communities that are getting decentralization employment i feel that it is just a comment not a question
in the smaller communities they do not have any hunting equipment perhaps because they have other equipment that are traditional but in bigger communities
some inuit people have less equipment for hunting just using this as an example
we would like to help all the communities in the kitikmeot region larger communities some inuit people do not have any equipment what so ever to hunt
i can see the smaller communities have the same problem but at the same time they do more hunting than the larger communities
they have more equipment in what i have seen
but at the same time we have to help or assist support them all whether they are bigger communities or smaller communities
that is just my comment at this time
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr alakannuark
mr minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairperson
this is not really a question but more like a comment
like many members i have mentioned it in the house that the smaller communities will not be getting decentralised jobs and the members wanted to know how they would be supported just like the larger communities
we will consider the smaller communities as well as we considered the larger communities
for them to plan their needs as well as the needs of the larger communities
i have mentioned before that there is more than one community that we are doing planning for
we have different ways of creating economy for each community
not just to the economy of the communities but also to provide some assistance for their hunting and to be able to provide for themselves by making money by hunting and other means
for those smaller communities that do not have very much of hunting equipment nunavut tunngavik incorporated has some money set aside to provide for their hunting equipment
but they could get assistance if their application is approved
the nti has their own assistance program
we would like to be able to help them as well but we are working with those other agencies to provide them with funding when we are asked to assist the agencies that provide those kinds of funding
the department of sustainable development you know what kinds of funding that we have
we have operations  maintenance total government budget of 5 percent
we do not have any extra money to provide for the members comments
we have been thinking about doing something to help those hunters that the member is talking about
we do not have any extra funding at this time
we will not forget the communities the smaller communities
thank you mr chairperson
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr alakannuark
mr alakannuark interpretation
thank you mr chairperson this is not really a question but a comment
in those communities that have sport hunting they have to use the dog teams to go polar bear hunting
some communities are given the opportunity to get sport hunters to go out caribou hunting
sport hunting is very important to the communities for their economy but there are many people that do not have dog teams in the communities
although some have sport hunting has to be open to every community
we would like to give each community an opportunity to do sport hunting for their own economy so whoever wants to be involved in sports hunting and who can provide those services so the people could have an economic base in their community
i expect that if there is sport hunting available for all the people
chairperson interpretation
that was just a comment but if minister kilabuk would like to make a brief comment on mr alakannuark s comment
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when people in the communities take the sport hunters out polar bear hunting it is a very good economic base for the people of nunavut
it provides about 3 million dollars a year to the communities of nunavut
there are about 125 people in the nunavut region at this time that provide sport hunting
we have put aside 3 million dollars for sports hunters for the nunavut residents
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr alakannuark
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i have two questions for the minister
the first question is in the business plans of sustainable development i understand that there is money for advertising for arts and crafts
will the arts and crafts made by local people be displayed through advertising to people that might be prospective buyers
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
minister kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
we know that there are people that are buying arts and crafts from the communities and some communities do not have any opportunity to do this
so we have set aside some funding to advertise the sale of arts and crafts in the communities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the reason i asked is because sometimes the people that bring their crafts to the co op and this is an economic base for some of the people in the communities i just wondered if we would have any problems with the co ops if we were to sell to other people
do they just purchase i am just thinking about the co op that should be provided with the selling of arts and crafts in the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the government will not compete with the co ops or other agencies to sell those arts and crafts made by the people in the communities
i just wanted to say that the arts and crafts that we do sell at this time are just for the sake of advertising at this time
thank you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes thank you very much for the response and i will not worry about this any more
the other item was already mentioned by mr alakannuark
our community has a lot of fish lots of arctic char and i know that there are other communities that have a lot of arctic char
they used to have commercial fishing in the igloolik area but today the commercial fishing is not being utilized enough
they just go fishing for their own use
i just wondered whether a study has been done to see which provinces or places or businesses would like to purchase fish to sell in the restaurants
i wonder whether ottawa has made any request i know that there is a lot of demand for arctic char for marketing in the other centres
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i used to work for fisheries and oceans and i will just answer on their behalf
the business of marketing fish is running very well in some communities and not very well in other communities
just as an example for those people that do commercial fishing the people that want to buy them are in need of those kinds of fish and we are looking into subsidizing the freight for those commercial fishermen
we have not done any review on the market or the people that would like to buy those fish from the communities
we have heard the problems that the communities we encountering in regards to the high cost of living or the high cost of freight when they want to ship their fish to be bought in the south even though there is a lot of fish in the communities
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
the pangnirtung fish plant does that plant buy fish from other communities
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
at this point i am no longer working at the fish plant so i cannot tell you what they do at this point
when i used to be at the pangnirtung fish plant when appropriate we were able to get some fish from the surrounding communities as long as there was a market for them but at this time i cannot answer you
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i am not saying that i am blaming the fish plant but perhaps according to my thoughts the fish plant in pangnirtung no wonder it has to be a viable business
they requested that all the fish that is sold commercially in the baffin region has to go through the fish plant in pangnirtung
ever since then in hall beach and igloolik ever since that fish plant was established it was even harder for the fishermen to sell their fish
i do not know whether this has been a good idea but that has been my thought so therefore i asked it
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
if you would like to respond i will leave that up to you mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
yes i can only talk about the past operations of the fish plant
for the communities that are not adjacent to pangnirtung if they tried to send their arctic char it would have been too expensive to send it by freight
at this point marketing the arctic char from nunavut to the south the health regulations and inspectors are very rigid
the people who buy the fish want to get the best fish that has never been frozen they want it as fresh as it can be
i know that they would like to buy more fish in some parts of the year so there are different reasons but the communities if they would like to apply for funding for fisheries we have no choice but to look at their application
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr kilabuk
yes that is entirely true that the food regulations are very powerful and rigid
i know that since i have seen it myself
mr irqittuq do you have any further comments
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr chairman
commercial fisheries and the arctic char when you take them down south and when you make a trip down south many southerners would like to buy arctic char and they have a large interest in it
perhaps you can do a study or a review as to who we can market the arctic char to
for example the big fisheries plants would like to buy a certain kind of fish
perhaps if you can do a review as to where we can market the arctic char
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr irqittuq
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
there are various problems that we encounter
we do want to do a review and we need to train the people on how to handle fish properly
because we did not have the staff capacity to do that last year as i have stated before i would like to see a new position in the department who can work on the fisheries and sealing side
the position was advertised in regards to the questions that you are posing and i know that the issues that you are questioning could be included in the position responsibilities
i know that due to a lack of capacity i had requested that there be a new position established within our department so that person could look into the sealing and fisheries side
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
when it was with the previous government the gnwt when the hunters injured themselves or were injured they were able to apply for workers  compensation or to insure their equipment
however within the department of sustainable development the budget saysinterpretation endshunters and trappers to replace the equipment lost as a result of natural disaster
interpretation that is what it says but it is only 15 thousand dollars budgeted for that purpose
last year there was no funding but this is 15 thousand dollars
mr chairman if my brand new skidoo went through the ice and i were to replace that skidoo it would cost about 10 thousand dollars
this 15 thousand dollars is only good for one person as disaster compensation
aren t you going to increase that amount or is this just an initial stage
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i know that it is small and i agree with you
in spite of that we have not received any applications as of yet for disaster compensation
if there was compensation for some accident the policies were inherited from the gnwt
for example if they lost their goods because of weather that is what this disaster compensation is geared towards natural disasters
i have been working with my staff to review how we can improve this or come up with different options
at this point in time because we have requested people that can work on this issue we are reviewing it at this point to find out who would be the most capable person to work on compensation
the policy was inherited from the gnwt and does not reflect nunavut
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
this 15 thousand dollars is only enough for one person to buy one snowmobile or to buy hunting equipment
i find that this is very small looking at the 26 communities of nunavut and looking at the number of hunters that we have
i know that once these hunters realize that they can apply for this compensation i know that they will say that this amount is too small
it has occurred that more than one hunter has lost equipment at the same time
it is already evident that this figure is going to be too small
perhaps the minister could consider in the future increasing that amount or perhaps request other departments to provide further funding for this particular item
i was wondering if he was willing to increase this sometime in the future
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
perhaps you and i will be fighting over that
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
before everybody fights over that yes i knew that this amount was much too small
if we had lost three or four snowmobiles then this amount would already be too small
this is already in our proposed review and i know that within our department if we are going to be including that compensation part that is the only way we can proceed with that is if we receive support from the other departments
in our reviews that have been done for example if we budgeted 100 thousand dollars here i would have a concern if we are going to make this funding available just like that the hunters might put themselves in danger because they know that they will be compensated if they lose their hunting equipment
that s the kind of question that i ask myself if they lost their snowmobile for example through thin ice the hunter would know that he would be compensated if he lost his skidoo
that is why i am a bit leery about as i have stated before
perhaps if we can look at insurance rather than compensation i think it would be more beneficial
but it is already going to be reviewed
as i have stated before this is not the last and final decision
we will be able to make a final decision only after the results have come in from the final report
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr barnabas
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr chairman
i agree with the minister and we understand it became a little bit clearer when we realised that our hunting equipment and we became aware that there is insurance required on hunting equipment and so on
but then again there was a problem mr chairman
when some of the hunters lost their equipment they tried to get their money back and the only response that we got from our government is that the money set aside for compensation was used for chartering airplanes to look for the hunters
therefore there was no more money available to pay for the hunters who lost their equipment
is that still going to be the case with this present government
for example if they were provided gas would the response be that there was no money available because the money was used to buy gasoline
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr barnabas
mr minister
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
if i understood the member correctly the money set aside for compensation i believe his question was whether we were going to have the same practices as the past government
this money is not for search and rescue
we will have to find other money to pay for those types of operations
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
my question as i have not seen any figures in front of me for the soapstone quarries
some of them are getting very dangerous and i am sure that the soapstone quarries between kimmirut and cape dorset are not the only ones that are dangerous
my question is do you have any money set aside for soapstone quarry sites so that they will be in safe conditions or would you have any money to be made available if an emergency case arose
or if the soapstone quarries became a safety issue would there be any money to be used for reviewing those soapstone quarry sites
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr akesuk
mr kilabuk
hon peter kilabuk interpretation
thank you mr chairman
for soapstone we have set aside some money through the community initiatives program
last year we spent about 37 or 38 thousand dollars for quarrying
the major portion of the money was used in the keewatin region but they are provided money
one of the concerns that we have is the safety of those soapstone quarry sites
because of that we are reviewing those sites
we have safety issues that have to be considered and we are reviewing whether to insure the carvers just like the regular work force
they do need to have soapstone made available to them
we are reviewing this as a whole as the department of sustainable development
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr minister
any further questions
mr tootoo
mr tootoo
thank you mr chairman
mr chairman it is not so much a question as just a comment
listening to and reading over the minister s opening comments and reviewing the business plan you see a lot of concentrating on areas of capacity building at the community level
i think that s important if we are ever going to have more self sufficient communities that is where we are going to have to concentrate our efforts on and i agree with my colleague s comments earlier on ensuring that we do develop those areas
i see things like the sealing strategy the fishing strategy the prospectors program nunavut arts and crafts nunavut tourism those types of things and under the harvester s program
those are more of the traditional type of economy and it s a fact that a lot of the population in nunavut that is unemployed right now is due to a lack of education and opportunity in the communities for those people
i think a good example of a success story almost or the potential of things is the clam diving going on in clyde river
that is an example of a way to some individuals that don t have any formal education in anything but have the capabilities to learn these skills and the potential to turn it into something that they can become self sufficient and sustain their families
it also provides a huge economic boost to the community
another thing that one of my colleagues said earlier was about diversity
i think if you look at nunavut there are so many untapped resources we have that have not been capitalised on these are the types of things that we need to take a look at exploring and finding ways to promote them and develop new programs and services that will expose those markets and those opportunities that we have
when you look in newfoundland where they are selling ice for water and vodka and everything else last time i looked we have a big chunk of ice up here
those types of things that you don t need a really highly skilled workforce to take advantage of
i believe in anything the success of whatever it is that you are trying to do is to capitalise on the strengths that you have and i look at nunavut and i see our strengths that we have and the resources that we have
we have to find ways to help individuals capitalise on their strengths in the traditional economy and things like that the sealing strategy makes it very clear the effect that the movement against furs had on the traditional economy and the way of life here in nunavut
i think we have to look at ways through carving through crafts through tourism fisheries not only our natural resources but our non renewable resources that are here we have to find ways to culture and develop and foster them so that they grow and provide opportunities in all our communities to help them become more self sufficient
to help nunavut diversify so that we do become more self sufficient and create an economy that is not just based on government employment in the communities
it is something that is there in every community
as i said if i could be paid to take someone out to do something that i love that would be a bonus
those are the things that the people of nunavut can do and can do well and they love doing it
so if you can do something that you love doing and it is a part of you and make some money at it then i think those are the types of things that we should try to develop
i see some of those things in here and i realize they can t be done overnight
i look forward to see some of the things along those lines of developing and fostering those types of industries
the are opportunities for people of nunavut
that is it mr chairperson i just wanted to share those thoughts with the minister and his staff i don t need a response i just wanted to share that
thank you mr chairman
chairperson interpretation
thank you mr tootoo
just to make a point in regards to clam digging it is not in clyde river it is in broughton island or qikiqtarjuaq i am sorry

change of name project
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to inform the legislative assembly of some positive developments in regards to a problem that many nunavummiut face when they try to register a change of name
in the past this was always a difficult process because of the complex forms that had to be completed and the documentation that had to be provided
many people for one reason or another were not able to complete the process and have their name legally changed
i am pleased to say that our court services division and the department of justice have been working on some practical solutions to the problem
for example we are designing a new form that will be much easier to use than the old one
second there will be an inuktitut speaking person who will travel with the court to the communities to help people with their applications
also there will be a 1 800 number that people can call in order to set up an appointment with that person when he or she is in the community
third radio announcements will be made in the communities to inform people about the timing of assistance in their community as well as the 1 800 number
we will be offering the services first in iqaluit
the project start date is some time in june
our radio announcements are planned to begin around the end of april or early may
it is important to remember that maliganik qimmirutit is addressing the issue of name change
for now our court services division is working to put in place some practical and immediate steps
the recommendations of maliganik qimmirutit can be incorporated into the program when they are made
mr speaker this is an important project that will helpfully remove a bureaucratic problem that has faced nunavummiut for many years
changing your name should be much easier in the near future

importance of carvers
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
firstly i want to inform members that although i did go home for the weekend it was a short one as i had to travel on good friday and travel back on easter monday besides the fact that i got ill but i did have an opportunity to see my children which was a joyous occasion
this morning i stand to speak for the carvers of nunavut
at this time the carvers are having a better time working outside the weather is warming up and the sun is staying longer
it is very hard for carvers to work outside in the winter and before i became a member of the legislative assembly i was a full time carver and that was my livelihood so i know what the carvers have to go through during the winter seasons
when you are working outside the machinery and equipment do not operate properly because they get frozen
electrical appliances just get burnt and become useless
when your equipment breaks you have to get replacements and they are expensive
they do have to look at the safety issues because they are working with electrical appliances
they also have to wear masks to prevent the dust from being inhaled
sometimes in the winter seasons it is minus forty or fifty in nunavut
the masks tend to freeze up and since the moisture condenses in the mask they become frozen and become quite useless
mr speaker i would like to get unanimous consent to conclude my statement
speaker
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement
are there any nays
there are no nays
proceed mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker and colleagues for giving me this opportunity to voice my concerns on this very important issue
as i was saying earlier the equipment masks become useless
they are our protection and we have to look how we can have a better program for carvers
since carving is a livelihood for many people they work under extremely harsh conditions
we carvers are very important their art is made in nunavut and it is unique
the carvers of nunavut go out of the country to art shows and at the same time they are representing inuit qaujimajatuqangit
they also depict the legends of the inuit through their artwork
i am very proud of the nunavut carvers because they keep our tradition alive today
we as the government of nunavut will have to look at how we can improve the conditions of the work environment of the carvers
they also have to go very far to quarry their soapstone because the deposits are not in the communities
we have to support our carvers because they are extremely talented and we as the government of nunavut will have to help them because they do showcase us to the rest of the world

name changes
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
welcome back we are very glad to see you again
i would like to thank the minister of justice for making his statement earlier in regards to name change
in most cases the inuit surnames or names are written with misspellings
my father s name is mikituk bruce and his father was tommy bruce
when the surname project with abe okpik went out he wrote the surnames and what he did with my father s name was that he changed the names around so the children s surnames all became mikituk so he became bruce mikituk
he was employed but when he retired he could not get his pension because of the change in the names
he was mikituk bruce at one time and then in the department of justice he was bruce mikituk
this created a problem when he tried to get his pension
he had to go to social services for income support because he had to keep up the daily expenses because he had worked for a lot of his life
our names are very important to us as inuit and at times even people who are related especially men have different surnames although they had the same father
i am sure those mistakes will be corrected shortly
i am very glad we are going to have this project because our names are important to us as inuit
thank you mr speaker

clyde river iceberg water bottling project
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to take this opportunity to talk about an initiative that was discussed in clyde river on november 16 1999
mr speaker the people of clyde river and the hto were talking about a project related to icebergs
because of the large number of icebergs the ice has been going out later than usual residents wanted to figure out what kind of opportunities were possible
the people of clyde river decided to started planning to set up a business were they would bottle water iceberg water
it is a very good initiative mr speaker
the ships and the airlines i hope will be more than glad to help us in transporting or exporting the iceberg water outside of our community
we would like to get this business going and we will be planning and establishing a plant where we would bottle water the people of clyde river would like to market water of iceberg ice water
it is not established yet but we are looking forward to setting up one

inuktitut in schools
hon jack anawak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i am very happy that the people in rankin inlet had a meeting yesterday in regards to education where they also talked about inuktitut curriculum
they feel that it is very slow being established in the schools and they strongly feel that we should use inuktitut curriculum
inuktitut language should be taught the same way as english is in the school
it would be very good to have inuktitut curriculum and language schooling in the schools in nunavut
i think it should be promoted in the school as well
it is part of the parent s responsibility in promoting the inuit languages in the school as well as in the home
for those people that feel inuktitut language training in school would slow their academic schooling should think about it a little bit more because they could use the inuktitut language in many different areas
it will not slow down the schooling of the younger children and i want to say that i am in support of inuktitut language curriculum in the school
for example in kugluktuk they use inuktitut french and english and they are very capable of successful schooling using those languages
i do not think it should be just english in the school inuktitut should be in the curriculum as well

thank you mr speaker i rise today to thank the honourable member from cambridge bay yesterday for making a statement thanking the regular members for taking the time to meet with a delegation from his community
mr speaker the delegation consisted of frank annaluk who is a respected elder the mayor his worship keith peterson and martha angulalik
i would like to thank the member from cambridge bay for bringing those people to meet with us
i believe that it was a very informative meeting
the members got some good clear information from the meeting
i would encourage all members if the need arises to try to do the same thing
i believe this type of action is what a lot of nunavummiut hope to achieve or accomplish with the creation of nunavut
that type of openness and accessibility to their government and again i would just like to thank the honourable member from cambridge bay mr ng for providing us with an opportunity to obtain that valuable information from his community

pension benefits
mr barnabas
i rise today on behalf of the pensioners
i believe that they have to be more informed about their retirement benefits that they have accrued
i believe that they should be informed about all the benefits that are being made available by the government
i have noticed that past government employees who have been long time employees when they retire from their jobs especially the people who used to work for the department of public works did not have certificates of their benefit coverage that came in with their cheques
also the majority of the time they couldn t fill out forms
there were some past department of public works employees who never got their severance pay some of them are deceased
i believe that this present government should take every opportunity to inform their staff of what kind of benefits they have because past employees of the gnwt never got their benefits

support for hunters
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to discuss some if the issues that we are dealing with in department of sustainable development
a lot of the full time hunters need more support from our government because of the low cost of the seal skin pelts and also fish that are not always marketable
narwhal tusks are in demand but we can not get sufficient income through the sale of these natural resources
the hunters of today work extremely hard to provide food for their families and it is still a tradition of today even though there is a lot of difficulties that come with it
the hunter s equipment are extremely expensive but still the full time hunters through perseverance still keep the hunting tradition
i know that mr speaker looking at the rest of canada there are the farmers who get subsidies from the government and also benefits so that farming will keep on going
however the hunters of nunavut do not get any benefits or subsidies from the government and they get very little from the nunavut tunngavik through the hunter support program but it is not sufficient
it is also obvious that parks and recreational activities are provided a lot of money for example the camp grounds outside of the communities parks which will be provided with lots of money over the next 5 years
we are talking about millions of dollars here and that is just for recreational activities
mr speaker i would like to get unanimous consent to conclude my statement
speaker
the member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement
are there any nays
please proceed
mr irqittuq
mr irqittuq interpretation
thank you my colleagues and mr speaker
looking at it from the hunters and trappers point of view if we are rich we go out to the parks and the campgrounds and we have our picnic and have our tea and that is for the well off people
but look at it from the other side of the coin
there are the hunters and trappers who are working extremely hard
it is up well over twenty dollars for bullets and if i lose one it means that i lose a dollar
look at the price of gasoline which in my community it is considered cheap if it is seventeen dollars per five gallon can
in the other communities it is probably twenty eight dollars per can
although that is the case mr speaker the hunters of nunavut are working very hard
the inuit of today do not participate in the wage economy enough
if there is food we will give to our neighbours
we still have that tradition of sharing because of that the hunters of nunavut should be a priority in our discussion in this house
we should provide them benefits and subsidises

nunatta campus graduation
hon ed picco
thank you mr speaker
good morning
last thursday many members of this house were able to attend the graduation ceremonies at nunatta campus here in iqaluit
the graduates were from all over nunavut
we are aware the bachelor of education degree from mcgill university in montreal
mr speaker unlike the south most of our students are mature students with children and family responsibilities
to successfully complete their studies takes dedication and support from the college and from their families
mr speaker an honorary diploma in adult education was also awarded to a long time northern resident and adult educator ann freda
ann used to be an adult educator mr speaker in cape dorset
actually she provided my first on the job training as an adult educator in cape dorset several years ago when i was an adult educator and she is well known as a hard working person and dedicated to adult basic learning
mr speaker premier okalik was a guest speaker and the valedictorian address was quite moving
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the arctic college graduates and the staff of arctic college for their dedication and professionalism
a special congratulations to mrs ann freda on behalf of her many colleagues and former colleagues and friends

contracts for purchase and supply of fuel
hon manitok thompson
good morning mr speaker
mr speaker i rise today to respond to a question posed to me by the mla for iqaluit centre mr tootoo on march 22nd 2000
the member requested clarification on two responses i had previously provided concerning the contracts for the purchase and supply of fuel and fuel in the change in fuel transportation costs
the current contract for the purchase and supply of fuel was signed in april 1999
this contract is in effect for a 3 year resupply season 1999 2000 and 2001
the 1999 resupply was the first under this new contract
the overall transportation cost of the new contract is fixed over the 3 season term
however the unit cost will fluctuate depending on the volume of fuel that is ordered annually
resupply volumes will depend on capacity and annual sales volumes which fluctuate with weather conditions

thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i would like to respond to a question posed to me on april 25 by the member for quttiktuq mr barnabas
following the closure of the polaris mine cominco will be required to re claim the site back to its original condition
over the past two years cominco have been conducting an environmental site assessment
based on that assessment they are now preparing a closure and reclamation plan
the requirement to reclaim the site is part of cominco s water licence and land lease of the polaris mine
cominco will soon have a draft of this plan available for review and comments their goal is for their final plan to be completed by september 2000 that reflects consultations with affected communities
cominco was recognised as a world leader in mine reclamation and i am confident they will do an excellent job of reclaiming the polaris mine site

oral questions
question 523   13
housing subsidies for elders
mr nutarak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yesterday i think it was yesterday i asked a question which i will bring up again to the minister responsible for housing
elders who have their own private houses and who live on a pension have to pay for utilities like land rental water and other utilities
are there no subsidies or benefits that are provided to elders who own their own homes
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
this is an ongoing concern to the elders who are homeowners because they are not able to keep up with the monthly bills
i can use an example of people who are living in rental units
if they are over 60 they do not pay for rent at all because they are elders and because they are respected
however for the homeowners that are over 60 although they are elders if they are homeowners they pay for all the bills be it land lease water or operations  maintenance of the house
it is very obvious some of these elders are having a hard time keeping up with the monthly bills
i was watching tv last night and i found myself fidgeting around the pen
so i will put it down
i do know when they pay for fuel their fuel can be reimbursed by social services if they fill out a form
i believe we will have to review this as the nunavut housing corporation and how we can look at providing benefits for subsidies to the elders
the housing corporation are not the people who deal with land leases or water delivery or those sorts of things
i think the nunavut government departments should work together to review the whole process because this is an ongoing concern by the elders
i would like to thank the person who posed this question because sometimes elders are intimidated and do not ask their own questions

community contribution to capital project
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
uqaqti like the honourable minister i watched myself on tv too last night and noticed i was giving people an evil eye and i will try not to do that either
my question today mr speaker is to the minister of education
we all know we had a trying time approving the education budget
there was a lot of controversy around it but we finally got it through i would like to thank the minister for approving the design money for the jonah amitnaaq school because our light fixtures are falling and it s full of asbestos because it is the oldest school in nunavut
i wonder if the minister would commit to my community that if my community raised an extra 20 percent for the larger gym would he commit to having that in the plan
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk
thank you mr speaker
we certainly would look at the community needs in that arrangement because we already set a precedent on it and individual communities could negotiate what kind of arrangement they would like to have including the community s involvement in funding the larger gyms
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you minister supplementary
mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti it is no secret that the jonah amitnaaq school has been cancelled or put on hold for the last eight or nine years
like i said earlier it is the oldest expanding school in nunavut at this time
my community when they did the initial community consultations and the early stages of the design said they would like to have a larger gym
it is a larger community and they knew there would be extra cost involved
would the minister be receptive if the local dea got involved in it within the next week to start the design
the design is being started and we know designing takes weeks sometimes years
would the minister commit to meeting with the dea to start discussions immediately on the enlarged gym in our community

adult technical training courses
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
also would like to welcome you back to the speaker s position because we missed you
you had a very good reason to leave the session and thank you for coming back
at this point in time mr speaker i would like to direct my question to the minister of education
the nunavut arctic college i believe i understand that given the opportunity they could have training programs plumbing programs training programs and small engine programs because when we do these adult training courses they are very beneficial for the communities
i would like your department to clarify that to me
looking at nunavut as a whole especially my community in the nattilik area today the students who dropped out of school do speak english but they have not completed their high school yet
we would like to see them given training because in nunavut we now have new things that we are not used to such as snow machines that need welding
so we have this new equipment and new technical stuff in nunavut and i do know a person in my community can do training on welding and who can be an instructor and who can train a person to be a mechanic
we do have people who know about plumbing in our communities
my question to the minister is do you have any plans in place to train for these kinds of opportunities
thank you mr speaker
speaker
just to remind my good friend to keep his preambles short
mr minister
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
different programs are offered by arctic college
we do provide training courses through arctic college and they are given funding by way of applying directly from the communities for training programs
i am sure that your community can do the same
for example guide training we do have guide training programs for people even though they are unilingual
we can look at the communities  requests perhaps by way of third party funding
so we are open to the communities needs and applications
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary
mr puqiqnak
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
yes
if i understood you yes i understand now
thank you
in regards to the third party i think you are saying they could have third party funding
my community or my constituency would have to fill out a form and give it to your department
do you have any application forms available for that
thank you mr speaker
speaker
minister arvaluk
hon james arvaluk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
they are not actual application forms
they are proposals
that is what we go through
that is what we use
thank you mr speaker
speaker
supplementary
mr puqiqnak interpretation
thank you mr speaker
my two communities in my constituency are quite small and usually the instructors rarely go to my community to those two small communities they usually go to larger communities to hold training programs
why do we not use the smaller communities for training programs
usually that does not happen because my two constituencies do have capable people who can instruct
for example in pelly bay and other communities they do have very capable people who can be instructors why do you not use the smaller communities as training centres through arctic college
i think we should make those training programs available to the smaller communities
i would like the minister s department to be sensitive to that
thank you
speaker
that was just a comment
i do not think that requires an answer

i would like to ask the premier i know that there was a five year review done on the nunavut land claim final agreement forwarded to the department of executive for review

are there any plans for the department to do some type of review on some of the concerns that were raised related to the government
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
there were numerous issues raised in the report and it was produced before our term was started
it was a five year review from 1993 to 1998
so it was before our government came into force
i can say as the nunavut government we have done quite a bit to rectify some of the concerns raised
we have been in office for just over a year
we have a new contracting policy in place which implements the land claim agreement
we have set aside 1 million dollars for inuit employment and training
there are plans within our government through the minister of sustainable development to negotiate an iiba for territorial parks
we made this commitment that we will do our part in implementing the land claim agreement within the bathurst mandate
the minister of sustainable development is also setting up a fisheries division to assist in getting our fair share of fisheries along our coast
so i believe we have done quite well
that is one of the areas where we have done considerably well as a government

i am sure in the discussions that i had with the members from nti they are happy with the direction and the relationship between our government and nti
would the premier commit that if there are any on going changes or recommendations these are things that are planned or being made throughout this ongoing relationship would he commit to keeping the members informed of these new and upcoming possible changes
thank you mr speaker
speaker
mr premier
hon paul okalik
thank you mr speaker
certainly
i think we established a precedent in working with the members on the nni
i think the minister of sustainable development is doing a review of the wildlife act to implement the land claim agreement
so i am sure we will keep the members informed
i should mention that we keep in regular contact with nti in accordance with the clyde river protocol
i believe the president of nti also meets with regular members
so i am sure we will keep everyone informed
thank you mr speaker

oral questions
mr barnabas
question 527   13
support for new hires
mr barnabas interpretation
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker i think it has been two years or over if i remember correctly since we were trying to pay off our 100 million dollar deficit
the government equipment was being sold to pay off the deficit
so i will be directing my question to the minister responsible for housing
my question is we do have staff housing for nunavut staff employees
if an employee is coming from sanikiluaq to work in iqaluit would they be given equipment or would they be given some funding to buy equipment
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr barnabas
minister responsible for housing ms thompson
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think the human resources minister is responsible for this question
mr speaker moving to another community usually the human resources department will work with the new employees
they discuss what kind of equipment and how many pounds of their property they can bring in when they are moving to another community
for example furniture tables chairs in regards to those things i would have to take your question under notice
i understand that for people who are hired usually the department of human resources discuss these items with new employees so i will take your question as notice and i will be open to the member if he has any further questions
in regards to the furniture in the house i will have to take your question as notice
thank you mr speaker
speaker
members just to note that our practice is when a minister takes a question as notice there will be no further supplementary
mr barnabas if you would like to raise your hand i will put you on the list again
oral questions
mr mclean
question 528   13 break in to finance building
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
uqaqti i was watching the news last night and there was a statement about the break and entered one of our most important buildings in nunavut
they had a picture of a large safe and i was immediately alarmed that i know that we don t have crown jewels in nunavut but can the minister responsible for finance give the members a brief update on what was absconded with last night or the night before
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister of finance mr ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker the member is correct
from my understanding it was a smaller household type of safe
obviously it was taken right out of the building and from my discussions with my officials there were some cheques to the government of nunavut for some payments of accounts or some invoices
right now there is a reconciliation being done
there were cheques on hand that hadn t been deposited
there was approximately 200 dollars of petty cash and from my understanding some taxi vouchers were kept in there
there are rumours that these taxi vouchers are appearing on the streets of iqaluit being discounted for 2 dollars from what i understand
thank you
speaker
thank you minister
supplementary mr mclean
mr mclean
ma na uqaqti
i will sleep a lot better tonight knowing that i ll be paid tomorrow and the people in question didn t abscond with our payroll
can the minister assure me that proper measures are going to be in place and proper security is going to be in place in the future in all government of nunavut buildings
because we know that crime is on the rise to make sure that sensitive documents or other such paraphernalia won t be taken
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr mclean
minister hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker yes after incidents like this we always review all the security provisions to see obviously wait and try to find out what did happen and try to take some corrective measures to minimize the possibility of it happening again
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr ng
minister i would like to suggest that you keep mr mclean personally updated as to the investigation as he is quite concerned about these taxi chits being stolen

question 529   13
communication systems for decentralization
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for decentralization
some jobs are going to some of the communities
my first question is are the communication systems being linked at this time
is that a priority in setting up the offices
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
mr premier
hon paul okalik interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i believe that the department of human resources would be more informed on this issue
in regards to cape dorset there will be offices and furniture from what i know and we will hear what is happening with the communications systems and the telephones
thank you mr speaker
i apologize if it is okay with the speaker i will re route this question to the minister for human resources as i should have done in the beginning
speaker
thank you mr premier
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
there are also the office supplies and the furniture
are they also being sent to cape dorset
speaker
minister thompson perhaps you can respond to that question
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i think it is best if i am responsible for all departments
yes we are working on it if there are going to be moves for example in baker lake some of the staff have already moved over and there are different times set for moving staff and furniture
if he would like more information on this issue and particularly on his community i can give him that information
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson
mr akesuk
mr akesuk interpretation
thank you mr speaker
will the qamanittuaq people be working to set up and ship all of this furniture and things
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr akesuk
minister
hon manitok thompson interpretation
thank you mr speaker
maybe i misinformed you in what i said
it was that some of the staff have been relocated to the communities
for example we have some that have gone to baker lake
that is what i said in case you misunderstood me
interpretation ends just to clarify the interpretation i was just saying that some of the decentralized positions have been filled as an example in baker lake
interpretation my staff at the regional offices of public works have staff and they are working on these issues for example in iqaluit rankin inlet and cambridge bay we have regional staff so they are working with the communities in their respective regions thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you ms thompson

question 530   13
update on clam divers
mr iqaqrialu interpretation
thank you mr speaker
i will direct my question to the minister responsible for human resources
i have been asking this question on numerous occasions
to date i have been asked by many people to bring clams from broughton island to iqaluit
i have received many requests up to now
what kinds of plans do you have for the clam divers
thank you mr speaker
speaker
thank you mr iqaqrialu
minister ng
hon kelvin ng
thank you mr speaker
mr speaker if the member could be more specific about what plans he refers to
i have mentioned in the past that the minister of sustainable development is trying to put together some training initiatives to allow those divers to be upgraded for commercial purposes
i have stated on other occasions in respect to trying to get the wcb officials to meet with the municipality and the divers or the hunters  and trappers  association
we will try and work out some kind of arrangement that would make things more accommodating but recognizing that it can t be done overnight
so those are a couple of things in response to the concern that the honourable member brought up on numerous occasions now
so if he has any more specific questions i can try to answer them
